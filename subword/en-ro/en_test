that 's enough !

i don't think laura andrisan is worth being paid much attention .
she 's a young woman , expelled from the high school in gherla commune at the time she was an eleventh grader , who has smeared lots of people .
but such a thing could happen for lots of reasons .
she gave the impression that , provided they had some nerve , hundreds of girls of the same condition could get in the situation of being able to tarnish even innocent people .
not to mention the atmosphere of vulgar scandal promoted in the society .
what 's the story about ?
before having gotten her high school graduation degree , laura andrisan worked for two or three publications in cluj city .
after getting her degree , she managed to make her way to three publications in bucharest .
in november she was part of the group of journalists who accompanied adrian nastase on his official visit to the white house .
lucky for her , at the white house and the state department she didn't show her real colours , but she did that in london where she was grabbed by bodyguards , thrown out on the street and banned from ever entering the building again .
many romanian politicians must have been hobnobbing with this demoiselle if she could generate such a low - down scandal on otv station .
this is no honour to newspapers either .
there are lots of geese and loafers hiding behind a journalist id .
( much to my regret , there was a time when such a thing happened at " evenimentul zilei " too ) .
but it wasn't only laura andrisan 's fault ( she 's the way she is ) , or the newspapers ' fault ( where selection criteria when hiring someone are often poor ) , it was also otv 's fault .
this tv station for which " ziua " daily 's manager sorin rosca stanescu fought tooth and nail is like a garbage tin daily dumping filth and amateurism over the ether .
dan diaconescu is carrying on here tenfold what he did on tele 7 abc station .
on the chair next to him ( sort of a chair for felons ) , you can see all sorts of politicians .
both top politicians and small politicians , slow - witted and cramming like calves driven to the slaughter house just to be seen by tv viewers , or bring accusations against some people or for who knows what other reasons .
the lack of any criteria , the appetite for vulgarity and gossip , adventurers and rumour spreaders have turned the above - mentioned tv station into an over - the - ether sewer .
the national audio / visual board , defeated in its initial attempt to shut down otv ( by whom else if not by politicians and mobsters who have free access to speak on the tv station ) , is now helpless .
the appalling scandal launched by a demoiselle who has made her way among newspapers , state institutions and top politicians is a sign that should set us thinking .
not quite anything can be allowed .
and we romanians have crossed the line .
we made journalists some bed - hoppers and some half - illiterate young women who first accompany official delegations , then traffic intelligence files , fish secrets out of and hobnob with politicians and civil servants , flip on tv and give the impression the whole country is like them .
you can smear the entire state pyramid even if you are of bucharest belt way descent .
and if you get angry you can set up your own newspaper or tv station .
that 's way too much .
that 's the sign that the garbage dump , instead of being turned environment - friendly , is advancing on the heart of the society , political parties and parliament , ministries and mass - media .
maybe what happened on otv on friday night will make most people exclaim in exasperation : that 's enough !
treptow 's lame arrest
by cornel nistorescu
monday , 21 octomber 2002
the american historian and his female accomplice have finally been arrested .
after a month - long noise made by the romanian press , the pedophile - historian was busted .
meanwhile , other pedophiles were arrested as well and immediately presented to the press as potential authors of similar crimes .
the high number of such unfortunate events triggered a firm reaction from prime minister adrian nastase .
he said pedophiles deserve to be sentenced to death .
but as this is not possible , they " must understand they will spend the rest of their life in romanian prisons " .
obviously , the message was addressed especially to foreigners fond of sexual tourism with underage individuals in romania , but also to those who tried to beat about the bush in the case of historian from iasi town .
but nobody asked for the death penalty as far as kurt treptow was concerned .
the newspapers and the parents of sexually abused children didn't speak for one second about the capital punishment .
the public would have been satisfied with much less than that .
to see that the law was enforced on every pedophile , whether a historian or an american citizen .
not a paragraph more or less .
but kurt treptow was extended special treatment .
his home was searched overnight in a judiciary raid seconded by a general .
and since then the character has vanished .
he wasn't shown to the press , no communiqu Ã© was issued .
the prosecutor 's office beat about the bush , so did the police , always hinting that the historian was a special person who had rendered i don't know what services to romania .
further more , when the press started to dig into the case and expose all sorts of details , presidential adviser ioan talpes held the umbrella to protect his friend ( or co - worker or god knows what treptow had been to him ) .
he recommended that the journalists protect the american because it was about a matter of confidentiality .
a romanian top official , instead of asking in his turn that the country 's laws be observed , tried to accuse the mass media .
he said that treptow 's doings were " overshadowed " by other " things published in the press " .
suspicious was also the fact that the presidential adviser made public a dangerous judgement .
at the height of the pedophilia scandal , he claimed that " there are things of a certain delicate nature " .
what would those things be ?
that historian treptow is an american , for example .
which planted into the ordinary people 's minds the idea that enforcing the law on an american citizen is a very delicate matter .
and things are even worse .
ioan talpes ' stupid statement was like a drop of water to the root of vadim - style nationalist feelings .
some romanians winced as if lashed : they 're beating about the bush because he is an american .
american ambassador to romania michael guest had to intervene to dispel some of the rumours .
he announced that " us embassy asks no protection for treptow " .
despite michael guest 's stand , the treptow case hasn't gained in transparency .
the state 's institutions continued to keep silent , as if they were investigating a martian caught by the romanian military .
meanwhile , the parents and the relatives of children sexually abused by kurt treptow were " delicately " warned they ' d better keep their mouths shut .
could it be that the police and the prosecutors adopted that attitude as they grew fond of treptow ?
i very much doubt that .
it was police and prosecutor 's office sources outraged by what was going on that leaked details about the case to the press , which is a sign they too were annoyed because their bosses ordered them to be discrete .
now , when kurt treptow 's deviant acts can't be covered up anymore , he was arrested like all the other pedophiles turned in to the police and presented to the press .
and it is also now , that just like by magic , adviser talpes is taking a step back trying to wash away the shame .
he tells us " i have never suspected him " .
logically speaking , we have to ask him a common sensical question .
if you didn't suspect him why did you get involved in this ?
couldn't you stay quiet in your presidential adviser seat without bringing ridicule upon yourself ?
we were not interested in the services rendered by treptow .
nobody spoke about the institution of death penalty .
all we wanted was a simple , ordinary and almost impossible thing .
that the law be also enforced in the case of a person close to mr talpes and to who knows who else .
the top of sums that add up
wednesday , 06 november 2002
a lot of ink will still flow to write about the richest 100 people in romania .
most of the citizens will get angry .
the romanian , cheated with privatization vouchers , still in the same staten he was when he parted with socialism , will not accept easily a top of those who made the most of transition .
among those 100 there are probably some who , in the following years , will carry on their shoulders , the burden of the myth of wealth .
a democratic society with a market economy needs such economic models .
but among the 100 there are also the big schemers of transition , some sham businessmen , even more contemptible than the cardboard billionaires .
among the 100 there are also " the protected ones " .
at a closer look and after a search through the archives , we will surely discover a few who are but an extension of the former and present romanian secret services .
on the same list there are also friends of the political parties .
if necessary , it is easy to see who in who 's time made a fortune .
fortune is one thing , money is another .
there is much gossip , many stories , and even a certain amount of amateurishness in the assessment of one 's fortune .
with all due respect for the authors of this top , it contains enough naiveties , typical of beginners .
you cannot assess someone 's fortune at fifty million dollars when he has debts of sixty million dollars .
if the state began to recoup the money , the next day some of the 100 would certainly be removed from the top .
then there are many millionaires with fortunes estimated at 10 - 20 million dollars or even more , 20 - 30 million dollars .
no matter how crazy romania may be , ten million dollars is quite something .
approximation as a method is rather good for a joke than for a top .
after all , what is the value of a fortune ?
the authors of the top say that they used all sorts of sources , including interviews .
the stock exchange does not play any part in the making of these figures .
nor does the tax authority or the balance sheets .
the value of a fortune is given by the market .
you cannot attach a sum of money to the name of someone , who bought , i won't say for how much , a factory from the state and assessed it in his ( or the journalists ' ) own way and then he said his fortune amounted to a certain figure .
if necessary , these millionaires in dollars , most often in need of liquidities , would be extremely happy to get rid of everything they have in exchange for 3 - 5 - 8 million dollars .
unfortunately , their strategy to buy for little money from the state and to sell it for higher price to the foreigners does not really work .
the wealth amassed by many of the 100 is not such a big deal .
they are good only to show them off and to carry them on the way to a real economy , when the purchased goods could be sold for at least half of the value shown in the top .
at the moment , many of the factories assessed for huge sums are not to be bought even for 1 million dollars in cash .
one more thing .
if we remove some of the names and several fortunes and make a total we will get what we might call " the romanian capital " .
but , if we start counting the sums of money that vanished from the banks which went bankrupt , we will notice with surprise that they are the same or are quite similar .
this shows that a large part of the romanian fortunes are equal to the " holes " in the banks .
in order to balance the sums we should add the money deposited in banks abroad , the donations made to the parties , the houses , the luxuries , and the lovers .
and so sums add up , that is a typical romanian counting worthy of a cheap show .
real money is not such an easy thing to find !
i know a filthy rich guy very proud of his fortune who asks his friends to lend him 5,000 dollars .
and once he grabs the money he avoids them for months !
what reactions does the millionaire top trigger ?
thursday , 07 november 2002
" top 100 wealthiest romanians " has become a subject of discussion , dispute or kibitzing .
there is big talk about money and especially about its link to politics .
all readers who called " evenimentul zilei " showed concerned about one single thing .
to what extent have these fortunes been legally made ?
why didn't the legislation work at all in the case of many persons ?
average people have nothing against wealth .
but they show signs that they refuse to accept a fortune made by illegal ways .
making such classifications is a common thing in other countries .
as it is a first for romania , the top of millionaires caused a state of shock in people , but , leaving aside the high quality graphic , it hides a completely amateur approach .
it is triggered by the lack of tradition , the lack of coherent selection criteria and of official information .
that 's why many characters on the list have unjustifiable figures written next to them .
we could say they are rather the result of some calculations made by the mind of a cardboard billionaire .
to some people , their presence in the top is just an opportunity to show off , which could make us believe they strove hard to inflate the figures so that they can be included in the top .
the problem with this top lies somewhere else .
it 's about the politicians ' wealth still not made public .
it is only in a few years from now on , when they are no longer in the game ( or maybe dominate it categorically ) that we will see the freight trains full of money coming out from the shadow of the backstage .
but this top is useful to them from another point of view .
it draws the general public 's attention to other people who set up serious businesses and to those who created empires with spineless foundations .
most of the latter are already known for the scams they managed to perform .
placed next to those who managed to build real economic mechanisms , they could get a drop of credibility and drag the former through mud , though they do not deserve that .
but the most interesting effect could be that on poor people .
poor people , who , as a rule , are hostile to the newly rich , will give up other topics regarding corruption and focus on the people included in the list .
if resounding names managed to make a hair breadth escape and not serve time in jail ( as they were helped to get away with their wrong doings ) and landed in this top with 300 or 500 million dollars associated with their names , needy people will say this is a corruption case .
they too are guilty .
they stole the factories .
the inflated figures of fortunes produced out of the hat could result in a deviation from the initial topic .
top 100 has merits as well .
it draws attention to the potential of the market economy .
it can make many people think in a more pragmatic way when it comes to money , fortune , property .
this extremely approximate list will certainly be corrected and improved .
if for 13 years the governments haven't been able to tell people to make money , some examples could mobilize them more than all the empty promises .
and so the economic competition will gather pace , new models will occur , we will see the confidence in this market grow and we ' ll come to the point when a top 200 , then 300 , then 500 richest people is needed .
when these tops include counties or county capital towns and the number of dubious rich people goes down to a reasonable percentage , we ' ll be entitled to say that the transition is over .
for the moment , it 's still groping in the dark .
and besides the lucky or the inspired , there are some individuals puffing themselves up who are clients of the romanian jails .
plus what is reserved for them in some other countries .
both a cudgeller and a securitate officer , and an mp , and a billionaire !

i don't know whether there are any levers by means of which the businesses of ristea priboi from southern oltenia region could be blocked .
nothing doing , as long as he doesn't grossly slalom through legislation paragraphs .
likewise , i don't know whether his affairs in vrancea county , where his name scarcely appears in papers , could be stopped .
nothing doing , as long as nobody has caught him red - handed ( as his fellows aren't very enthusiastic when it comes to such things ) .
mr priboi , as a businessman who also made deals in germany and the former yugoslavia , can live unconcerned .
obviously , fearing the law and god .
he 's free to make a sackful of money , to stand sponsor for whoever he wants , to keep friends , ladies or servants .
if mr priboi did all this using his cerebrum and cerebellum , we really would look at him with admiration .
but there 's something attached to his accomplishments .
mr ristea priboi is a romanian mp .
and before that he was an adviser to adrian nastase .
and before being an adviser to a top official , he was a political police officer .
reportedly , among many other things , he was in charge of overseeing the journalists with radio free europe at the time they were protesting against nicolae ceausescu and communism .
and we don't know exactly what mr ristea priboi did in germany .
securitate files are still carefully kept under wraps .
they might show us what other responsibilities comrade officer priboi had .
culture of " state secret "
all we might gain by the law of access to public information could be easily annulled if another law , the one referring to the protection of classified information , were adopted in the current form by the deputy house .
the law of access to information with public character , voted by last year but valid starting january 1 st 2002 , was probably one of the few real exercises of democratic administration of the legislative act in fund not only in form .
though the initial approach belonged to the liberals , the final variant includes significant contributions both from the civil society and from the government .
even if contradictory provisions in the oldest laws regarding the sri activity and the national security were still leaving enough space for confusions and hindering of application .
all it remained was that , by collective effort of he civil society , mass media and political environment , the implementation of the law provoke , step by step , major mutations of mentality and behavior in the romanian society .
as it often happens in romania , wonders don't last long .
all we might gain by the law of access to public information could be easily annulled if another law , the one referring to the protection of classified information , were adopted in the current form by the deputy house , very likely over this week .
beyond the absolutely necessary discussions on the text , the law reflects the dominant spirit of the political apparatus that conceived and promoted it .
it is , in fact , a real measure of the big distance that separates the form of the fund , that is , the multitude of public declarations about democratic values , democratic state , tolerance and transparence , dominant mentality , probably not only among the governors .
phrases as " national interest " or " national security " , usually defined from the standpoint of the power and so many times in history generating breaches , still remain deeply implemented in the collective mentality .
the idea of a society built around the individual , of the respect for his absolute right to free expression , and not of some abstract things that could eventually justify any meddling of the state in private space remains a still remote desire .
finally , the fundamental matrix of a society is given by the way in which private property is protected and by the nature of the relation between state and citizen .
unfortunately , in both chapters , romania remains essentially disconnected form the european space , which everybody declares we want to direct to .
it is obvious the dominant mentality at the public level cannot change over night .
but if the institutional construction and normative framework romania promotes - as a country in full integration process to the structures of the european union - not only do not intervene in order to shape up a new type of behavior at the public level but , on the contrary , strengthen the traditional perspective , the chances to really get out this kind of pattern remain , finally , purely hypothetical .
exceeding the general statements sphere , we should , maybe , remind a few things , as relevant as possible , in the context of the previous considerations .
as for instance article 19 of the law , which reviews a multitude of institutions that can classify information in the category " strictly secret of great importance " .
not to mention the extremely questionable category of " work secrets " , which will very probably render the law of access to public information inoperable even at the level of county r local councils .
another stipulation makes actually impossible the appointment of persons with double citizenship in high public functions , from the simple reason they are interdicted to have access to state secrets .
could those who have written the text of the law not to have learnt that in the baltic countries , which will join the european union in 2004 , such " suspect " individuals got in the highest state functions , including that of president ?
a former senator was talking about the existence of a real culture of secret in the romanian society .
pushing to derisory the enthusiasm of those who were saluting the important step to normality initiated by the law of access to public information , the new normative framework comes to give more consistency to informal mechanisms , well placed anyway , in the collective mentality .
postulating the primate of the mechanisms of the power of state in relation to the citizen 's rights .
whether this is the most proper meaning for the evolution of the situation in the romanian society , it is a question we all should answer .
vacaroiu dodges bid issue
with vacaroiu in the top , bid lost in one shot 12 billion lei .
the money could be a programmed loss , to mask the transfer of some sums to " gelsor group " .
over the last period , nicolae vacaroiu is not missing in the newspapers .
not for what he does as a president of the senate , but for what he has " achieved " as president of the bank of investments and development ( bid ) .
recently , vacaroiu has complained he was the target of a discrediting campaign .
the last accusations brought against the president of the senate are very clear .
the central press published two decisions of bid signed by nicolae vacaroiu as bid president .
a document dates since september 2000 - a decision by which bid accepts to buy shares amounting to 16 billion lei from the group " gelsor " - former property of vintu .
the second decision , in december 2001 , when vacaroiu was already president of the senate and wouldn't have been allowed to be bank president too , was referring to the sale of the shares in question to carmen mocanu with only 4 billion lei .
in other words , bid has lost in only four months , 12 billion lei .
moreover , carmen mocanu also appears in the list of persons that have withdrawn from the romanian discount bank , formerly sov property too .
the press suggested the bid operation would have been a programmed loss to mask , in fact , the transfer of a big amount of money to the " gelsor group " .
nicolae vacaroiu has avoided giving a clear explanation to press , saying all operations unfolded by bid at the time were in accordance to the legal stipulations .
nastase back empty handed from new york
gone in a north - american tour to impel romania 's integration to nato , the premier adrian nastase didn't manage to get any promise from the officials he met , a sign that the question marks at washington on our country grow bigger .
premier nastase 's presence to new york took place in a moment marked by , on one hand , by an unusual agitation produced over the last weeks in romania 's race for integration to the nato structures , and on the other by the confusion created by the political - economical scandals at bucharest .
as known , over the last period , different american officials , including the delegate of the administration of washington to bucharest , ambassador michael guest , expressed , among others , the worries related to the high level of corruption in romania , and the fact it represents a hinder in our country 's way to the north - atlantic alliance .
though he tried to minimalize the critics of the american authorities , the prime minister couldn't erase the negative impressions created in the american circles by the issue of corruption and the fact a series of american analysts predicted the non - inclusion of our country in the integration list that is to be announced at prague .
so that , the meeting with the general secretary of nato , george robertson , with the chief of american diplomacy , colin powell and the high representative of the european union , javier solana , without making any reference to the issue of corruption , focused on general problems related to integration , without bringing any new element as for our country 's chances to become part of the negotiations in the czech capital .
in his visit to new york , everything nastase managed to do was to get the support of poland 's president , aleksander kwasniewski and that of a democrat senator , for romania 's nato joining .
nudges under power 's table
psd threats with the break of the alliance protocol with pur is this party continues its approach to make up a parliamentary group in the deputy house .
pur has been taken under psd protection since 2000 in the period of the electoral campaign , when the humanist leader , dan voiculescu , the owner of the tv channel antena 1 , accorded media " support " by the television he leads .
the new parliamentary session starts with tensions within the ruling coalition .
on monday , the humanist deputies laid down at the permanent bureau of the deputy house a solicitation for the making up of their own parliamentary social - democratic humanist group .
the vice president of pur ( romanian humanist party ) , deputy florea voinea , stated pur presently holds 10 deputies and could represent a mixed parliamentary group , with pur deputies and independent deputies that joined pur .
the problem is psd doesn't seem to agree at all with the breaking of the parliamentary social - democratic humanist group .
the leader of the psd parliamentary group in the deputy house , viorel hrebenciuc , threatened that psd is determined to break the alliance protocol to pur if the party continues its approach to make up their own parliamentary group .
" the pur approach to make up their own parliamentary group is the approach of a small party wanting to become great " , hrebenciuc says ironically .
the psd vice president thinks the situation would be settled at the meeting between the negotiation commissions of the two parties that analyze the level of the protocol fulfillment and the opportunity to prolong the protocol .
it is hard to believe psd and pur will reach a definitive divorce .
psd still needs the media support from antena 1 and pur still has numerous men in administration , who would have nothing but to lose by the protocol breaking .
psd wants proofs ristea priboi was securitate torturer
psd deputy ristea priboi was accused by wener sommeraurer , one of the workers securitate investigated after the revolt in november 1987 , of being one of those who beat him .
" if the accusations regarding deputy ristea priboi confirm , he will have nothing to do here any more " , the general secretary of psd , cosmin gusa , stated .
a blue - worker from brasov , retired now , who participated in the revolt of november 1987 , identified priboi as one of the securitate officers who tortured him during the investigation .
premier adrian nastase asks for proofs from the habilitated institutions .
psd deputy ristea priboi is now in the middle of a new controversy .
he was accused by wener sommeraurer , one of the workers investigated by securitate after the revolt in november 1987 , of being one of those who had tortured him .
on monday , the general secretary of psd , cozmin gusa , declared that ristea priboi rejected all accusations regarding the fact he would have been a torturer , and announced he would sue those who made such statements .
according to gusa , if the accusations against priboi would prove to be true , he had nothing to do in the political life any more .
