what is a fenqing ?
fenqing is a chinese word which literally means " angry youth " .
this word has many translations in english such as cynical youth , young nationalists , hysterical youth and angry young men .
i personally like to call them mob youth or ignorant angry youth .
it is impossible to understand china without knowing what fenqing is and what role they play in the society in today 's china .
i will try to paint a portrait of a fenqing in this post .
what a fenqing is like ?
fenqing is someone who is usually below twenty years of age , though sometimes people who are at their twenties or older can also be identified as fenqing .
though you can find the majority of fenqing among high school and college students , age is not the most important feature .
what really matters is their outlook of china and the world .
what a fenqing does n't know ?
the fact that most fenqing are ignorant of many things determines their opinions and views of the world and china .
a typical fenqing does not know the answer to the following questions :
what are the differences between the nation , the government and the party ?
fenqing believe these three things are basically the same thing .
how large is the china 's territory and what is the ranking of its land area ?
fenqing were taught that china was the third largest country in the world , and they never knew it shrank a little .
what is a purpose of economic and social development ?
fenqing believe everything can be readily sacrificed to achieve " the grand goal " .
for them , the value of human life and dignity is readily expendable for the slogans and ideologies .
how the tax money is spent ?
fenqing do know or care they are in fact tax payers and has a right to know how their tax money is spent .
what is fenqing 's outlook ?
their ignorance and lack of social experience shaped their outlook :
u.s. is a monolith .
america is bad , bad and bad because bush is bad .
anti-japan and call for boycotting japanese products while enjoying japanese av or cartoons .
china 's stock market slumps because of the conspiracy of the imperialist western countries .
the price of housing in china skyrocketed because of the hot money of the international speculators .
western countries led by the u.s. are trying to encircle and contain china .
the internet should be censured and any bad information , like the flies or mosquitoes outside the room , must be screened and filtered .
cnn is evil because it lied , but it is fine for cctv to modify the information to maintain the stability of the society .
what is the role of fenqing in china ?
fenqing are often spontaneous , but it is easy to fan up their blind fervency - just tell them china has been attacked .
fenqing never realized that they are manipulated and they are among the first to be expended for the " greater good " .
their anger is harnessed and channeled to the designated objects , yet they are carefully guarded not to cross the line and overdo job .
fenqing are not patriots
over about a hundred years since 1840 , china was bullied , humiliated and brutally invaded by the industrialized western powers .
china is the longest continuation of a civilization , and for centuries , it was leading the world by its economic development and technological inventions .
the enormous suffering and humiliation over a century deeply hurt chinese people .
it became a national dream of china to drive out the western invaders and colonizers and stand tall in the world again with dignity and glory .
undeniably , this is the root of chinese patriotism and nationalism .
in a justified hostility toward the past western colonizers and invaders ( especially japanese ) , fenqing are a group people who turn a blind eye to the domestic problems or simply attribute everything bad to the imperialists .
they are conveniently absent when shoddy buildings collapsed , when farmers are displaced and the internet is turning into a glan ( the great local area network ) .
fenqing are not qualified to be called patriots for the simple reason they are ignorant of three simple political concepts i mentioned above .
they are party-triots .
who produced fenqing ?
when i played a movie about the war in iraq - no end in sight - to a group of young college students , a student came up to me and said : " our teacher of mideast history told us saddam was a national hero of iraq , and people lived a prosperous and a happy life under his regime . "
i was surprised to hear what she said , and told her what saddam did to kurdish population in northern iraq and the fact that he was once supported by the u.s. government during iran-iraq war .
will fenqing remain to be fenqing forever ?
no . i was a fenqing myself several years ago ( anti-japan ) , but now i moved on .
fenqing ca n't survive very long after they are exposed to the realities and truth .
once fenqing enter the society , see more and get busy making a living , they will change .
by the way , the internet is a catalyst to quicken the conversion of fenqing .
the history of tulips from turkey to holland
the tulip were originally a wild flower growing in the central asia and were first cultivated by the turks as early as 1,000 ad .
the flower were introduced in the westen europe and the netherlands in the 17th century by carolus clusius , a famous biologist from vienna .
in the 1590 's he became the director of the hortus botanicus in leiden , the oldest botanical garden of europe , founded in 1587 .
he was hired by the university of leiden to research medicinal plants and while doing so he got some bulbs from turkey from his friend ogier ghiselain de busbecq , the ambassador of constantinople .
he had seen the beautiful flower , called tulip after the turkish word for turban , grow in the palace gardens and sent a few to clusius for his garden in leiden .
he planted them and this was the start of the amazing bulb fields we can see today .
in the beginning of the 17th century the tulip were staring to be used as a garden decoration beside the former medicinal purposes .
it soon gained major popularity as a trading product , especially in holland .
the interest for the flower were huge and bulbs were sold for unbelievable high prices .
botanists started to hybridize the flower and they soon found ways of making it even more decorative and tempting specimens .
hybrids and mutations of the flower were seen as rarities and a sign of high status .
in the months of late 1636 to early 1637 there was a complete " tulipmania " in the netherlands .
some examples could cost more than an amsterdam house at this time .
even the ordinary man took part in the business .
they saw how much money the upper class got in the commodity and thought that this was an easy way of getting lots of money at no risk .
the bulbs was usually sold by weight while they were still in the ground .
the traders made huge amounts of money every month , and people started to sell their businesses , family homes , farm animals , furnishings and dowries to participate .
the government could not do anything to stop it , the trade was all about supply and demand .
but finally the tulip did not appear to be quite so rare to justify such high prices .
over-supply led to lower prices and dealers went bankrupt and many people lost their savings because of the trade .
this " tulip crash " made the government introduce special trading restrictions for the flower .
it is said that the flower became so popular because of the bright colours , dramatic flames and frilly petals .
in the 20th century they discovered that the frilly petals and dramatic flames that gave the flower its stunning look , in fact were the symptoms of an infection by the mosaic virus .
the healthy flower were supposed to be solid , smooth and monotone .
the virus came to the tulip from a louse living on peaches and potatoes .
these diseased varieties are no longer sold , what you can find is hybrids that look similar but are genetically stable .
coroner 's preliminary finding : jackson overdosed on propofol
( cnn ) -- the los angeles coroner has concluded preliminarily that singer michael jackson died of an overdose of propofol , a powerful sedative he was given to help him sleep , according to court documents released monday .
a search warrant filed in court showed toxicology reports found propofol in michael jackson 's body .
los angeles coroner dr. lakshmanan sathyavagiswaran reached that preliminary conclusion after reviewing toxicology results carried out on jackson 's blood , according to a search warrant and affidavit unsealed in houston , texas .
the affidavit , used to outline probable cause for search warrants of the offices of doctors who are believed to have treated jackson , disclosed many details of drugs given to jackson in the weeks before his death .
jackson family lawyer londell mcmillan said the report " reaffirms the very sad reality that there was a tragic and gross violation of duty and care for michael jackson . "
the publicist for jackson 's family said the " family looks forward to the day that justice can be served " .
" the jackson family has full confidence in the legal process , and commends the ongoing efforts of the l.a. county coroner , the l.a. district attorney and the l.a. police department , " the statement said .
the associated press is quoting a single law enforcement official , who said the l.a. county coroner ruled michael jackson 's death a homicide .
the los angeles county coroner 's office told cnn they had " no comment " on the report .
an lapd spokesman said the story did not come from their department .
" we will not comment on the " anonymous " law enforcement source that claims that michael jackson 's death will be ruled a homicide , " murray 's lawyer ed chernoff said in a statement on his firm 's website .
most of the reports by " anonymous " sources have been proven wrong .
we will be happy to address the coroner 's report when it is officially released .
the 32-page warrant said dr. conrad murray , jackson 's personal physician , told a detective that he had been treating jackson for insomnia for six weeks .
murray said each night he gave jackson 50 mg of propofol , also known as diprivan , diluted with the anesthetic lidocaine via an intravenous drip .
worried that jackson may have been becoming addicted to the drug , the houston cardiologist said he attempted to wean him from it , putting together combinations of other drugs that succeeded in helping jackson sleep during the two nights prior to his death .
on june 22 murray said he gave jackson a cocktail of drugs similar to what he gave him on the day he died , june 25 -- propofol , ativan and versed , which helped the star fall asleep , according to the documents .
on june 23 he gave jackson only the ativan and versed , which helped him sleep .
but on june 25 , other drugs failed to do the job , as murray recounted to detectives in an hour-by-hour account detailed by detective orlando martinez of the los angeles police .
at about 1:30 a.m. , murray gave jackson 10 mg of valium .
at about 2 a.m. , he injected jackson with 2 mg of the anti-anxiety drug ativan .
at about 3 a.m. , murray then administered 2 mg of the sedative versed .
at about 5 a.m. , he administered another 2 mg of ativan .
at about 7:30 a.m. , murray gave jackson yet another 2 mg of versed while monitoring him with a device that measured the oxygen saturation of his blood .
at about 10:40 a.m. , " after repeated demands requests from jackson , " murray administered 25 mg of propofol .
jackson finally went to sleep and murray stated that he remained monitoring him .
after approximately 10 minutes , murray stated he left jackson 's side to go to the restroom .
murray stated he was out of the room for about two minutes maximum .
upon his return , murray noticed that jackson was no longer breathing .
efforts at cpr proved fruitless , according murray .
shortly after murray said he found jackson not breathing , murray was on the phone with three separate callers starting at 11:18 a.m. and ending at 12:05 p.m. , according to the court documents which cite the doctor 's phone records .
" murray did n't tell this to anyone when he was interviewed , " the court documents said .
chernoff denied the timeline referenced in the affidavit .
much of what was in the search warrant affidavit is factual .
however , unfortunately , much is police theory .
most egregiously , the timeline reported by law enforcement was not obtained through interviews with dr. murray , as was implied by the affidavit .
dr. murray simply never told investigators that he found michael jackson at 11:00 a.m. not breathing .
he also never said that he waited a mere 10 minutes before leaving to make several phone calls .
in fact , dr. murray never said that he left michael jackson 's room to make phone calls at all .
the document also cited reports from staff at the university of california at los angeles medical center , where jackson 's body was taken , who said murray " admitted " to having given jackson flumazenil to counteract the ativan .
the document lists another five doctors and a nurse practitioner who reportedly treated jackson .
detectives ... believe that the miscellaneous prescriptions , from multiple doctors ... could have contributed to his death .
" it cannot be determined whether the cause of death is due to the actions of a single night and or a single doctor , or the grossly negligent treatment of several doctors over an extended period of time . "
according to the warrant and affidavit , murray said he was not the first doctor to give jackson the powerful anesthetic , which the singer called " milk " .
the drug has a milky appearance .
jackson also told murray about two unknown doctors in germany who gave him propofol .
documents show police found eight bottles of propofol inside jackson 's home .
a search of murray 's doctor bag , which he left at the house the day jackson died , contained multiple bottles vials of lidocaine and several bottles vials of propofol , ativan , versed and anexate .
the affidavit said a search of jackson 's home revealed " numerous bottles of medications " at jackson 's bedside that were prescribed by murray and two other physicians -- dr. allan metzger and dr. arnold klein .
many of the drugs have an indicated or off label use in the treatment of insomnia , the affidavit said .
metz ger 's lawyer told cnn last month that metzger -- who treated jackson in 2003 -- refused jackson 's request in april for a propofol prescription .
klein -- a dermatologist who also was jackson 's longtime friend -- has insisted he never gave jackson dangerous drugs .
jackson visited klein 's beverly hills , california , medical office just days before his june 25 death .
murray took the job as jackson 's personal physician in may , as the pop star was preparing for a series of comeback concerts set to begin in july at london 's o2 arena .
murray told investigators that jackson would not tell him what drugs other doctors had given him , but he did tell murray the medicine given to him by klein and metzger was not working .
according to the documents , the dea has been unable to find a record of dr. murray purchasing , ordering or obtaining any propofol under his medical license or dea number .
helen keller , 1880-1968 : " i try to make the light in others ' eyes my sun "
this week we finish the story of a writer and educator , helen keller .
she helped millions of people who , like her , were blind and deaf .
we reported last week that helen keller suffered from a strange sickness when she was only nineteen months old .
it made her completely blind and deaf .
for the next five years she had no way of successfully communicating with other people .
then , a teacher - anne sullivan - arrived from boston to help her .
miss sullivan herself had once been blind .
she tried to teach helen to live like other people .
she taught her how to use her hands as a way of speaking .
miss sullivan took helen out into the woods to explore nature .
they also went to the circus , the theater , and even to factories .
miss sullivan explained everything in the language she and helen used -- a language of touch -- of fingers and hands .
helen also learned how to ride a horse , to swim , to row a boat and , even to climb trees .
helen keller once wrote about these early days .
one beautiful spring morning i was alone in my room , reading .
suddenly , a wonderful smell in the air made me get up and put out my hands .
the spirit of spring seemed to be passing in my room .
" what is it ? " i asked .
the next minute i knew it was coming from the mimosa tree outside .
i walked outside to the edge of the garden , toward the tree .
there it was , shaking in the warm sunshine .
its long branches , so heavy with flowers , almost touched the ground .
i walked through the flowers to the tree itself and then just stood silent .
then i put my foot on the tree and pulled myself up into it .
i climbed higher and higher until i reached a little seat .
long ago someone had put it there .
i sat for a long time ... nothing in all the world was like this .
later , helen learned that nature could be cruel as well as beautiful .
strangely enough she discovered this in a different kind of tree .
one day my teacher and i were returning from a long walk .
it was a fine morning .
but it started to get warm and heavy .
we stopped to rest two or three times .
our last stop was under a cherry tree a short way from the house .
the shade was nice and the tree was easy to climb .
miss sullivan climbed with me .
it was so cool up in the tree we decided to have lunch there .
i promised to sit still until she went to the house for some food .
suddenly a change came over the tree .
i knew the sky was black because all the heat , which meant light to me , had died out of the air .
a strange odor came up to me from the earth .
i knew it -- it was the odor which always comes before a thunderstorm .
" i felt alone , cut off from friends , high above the firm earth .
i was frightened , and wanted my teacher .
i wanted to get down from that tree quickly .
but i was no help to myself .
there was a moment of terrible silence .
then a sudden and violent wind began to shake the tree and its leaves kept coming down all around me .
i almost fell .
i wanted to jump , but was afraid to do so .
i tried to make myself small in the tree , as the branches rubbed against me .
just as i thought that both the tree and i were going to fall , a hand touched me ... it was my teacher .
i held her with all my strength then shook with joy to feel the solid earth under my feet .
miss sullivan stayed with helen for many years .
she taught helen how to read , how to write and how to speak .
she helped helen to get ready for school and college .
more than anything , helen wanted to do what others did , and do it just as well .
in time , helen did go to college and completed her studies with high honors .
but it was a hard struggle .
few of the books she needed were written in the braille language that the blind could read by touching pages .
miss sullivan and others had to teach her what was in these books by forming words in her hands .
the study of geometry and physics was especially difficult .
helen could only learn about squares , triangles , and other geometrical forms by making them with wires .
she kept feeling the different shapes of these wires until she could see them in her mind .
during her second year at college , miss keller wrote the story of her life and what college meant to her .
this is what she wrote :
my first day at radcliffe college was of great interest .
some powerful force inside me made me test my mind .
i wanted to learn if it was as good as that of others .
i learned many things at college .
one thing , i slowly learned was that knowledge does not just mean power , as some people say .
knowledge leads to happiness , because to have it is to know what is true and real .
to know what great men of the past have thought , said and done is to feel the heartbeat of humanity down through the ages .
all of helen keller 's knowledge reached her mind through her sense of touch and smell , and of course her feelings .
to know a flower was to touch it , feel it , and smell it .
this sense of touch became greatly developed as she got older .
out of a world of darkness and silence , helen keller brought hope to millions
the name helen keller has had special meaning for millions of people in all parts of the world .
she could not see or hear .
yet helen keller was able to do so much with her days and years .
her success gave others hope .
helen keller was born june 22th , eighteen eighty in a small town in northern alabama .
her father , arthur keller , was a captain in the army of the south during the american civil war .
her mother was his second wife .
she was much younger than her husband .
helen was their first child .
until she was a year-and-one-half old , helen keller was just like any other child .
she was very active .
she began walking and talking early .
then , nineteen months after she was born , helen became very sick .
it was a strange sickness that made her completely blind and deaf .
the doctor could not do anything for her .
her bright , happy world now was filled with silence and darkness .
from that time until she was almost seven years old , helen could communicate only by making signs with her hands .
but she learned how to be active in her silent , dark environment .
the young child had strong desires .
she knew what she wanted to do .
no one could stop her from doing it .
more and more , she wanted to communicate with others .
making simple signs with her hands was not enough .
something was ready to explode inside of her because she could not make people understand her .
she screamed and struggled when her mother tried to control her .
when helen was six , her father learned about a doctor in baltimore , maryland .
the doctor had successfully treated people who were blind .
helen 's parents took her on the train to baltimore .
but the doctor said he could do nothing to help helen .
he suggested the kellers get a teacher for the blind who could teach helen to communicate .
a teacher arrived from the perkins institution for the blind in boston .
her name was anne sullivan .
she herself had once been almost completely blind .
but she had regained her sight .
at perkins , she had learned the newest methods of teaching the blind .
anne sullivan began by teaching helen that everything had a name .
the secret to the names was the letters that formed them .
the job was long and difficult .
helen had to learn how to use her hands and fingers to speak for her .
but she was not yet ready to learn .
first , she had to be taught how to obey , and how to control her anger .
miss sullivan was quick to understand this .
she wrote to friends in boston about her experiences teaching helen .
the first night i arrived i gave helen a doll .
as she felt the doll with one hand i slowly formed the letters , d-o-l-l with my fingers in her other hand .
helen looked in wonder and surprise as she felt my hand .
then she formed the letters in my hand just as i had done in hers .
she was quick to learn , but she was also quick in anger .
for seven years , no one had taught her self-control .
instead of continuing to learn , she picked up the doll and threw it on the floor .
she was this way in almost everything she did .
even at the table , while eating , she did exactly as she pleased .
she even put her hands in our plates and ate our food .
the second morning , i would not let her put her hand on my plate .
the family became troubled and left the room .
i closed the door and continued to eat .
helen was on the floor , kicking , screaming and trying to pull the chair out from under me .
this continued for half an hour or so .
then she got up from the floor and came to find out what i was doing .
suddenly she hit me .
every time she did this i hit her hand .
after a few minutes of this , she went to her place at the table and began to eat with her fingers .
i gave her a spoon .
she threw it on the floor .
i forced her to get out of her chair to pick the spoon up .
at last , after two hours , she sat down and ate like other people .
i had to teach her to obey .
but it was painful to her family to see their deaf and blind child punished .
so i asked them to let me move with helen into a small one-room house nearby .
the first day helen was away from her family she kicked and screamed most of the time .
that night i could not make her get into bed .
we struggled , but i held her down on the bed .
luckily , i was stronger than she .
the next morning i expected more of the same , but to my surprise she was calm , even peaceful .
two weeks later , she had become a gentle child .
she was ready to learn .
my job now was pleasant .
helen learned quickly .
now i could lead and shape her intelligence .
we spent all day together .
i formed words in her hand , the names of everything we touched .
but she had no idea what the words meant .
as time passed , she learned how to sew clothes and make things .
every day we visited the farm animals and searched for eggs in the chicken houses .
all the time , i was busy forming letters and words in her hand with my fingers .
then one day , about a month after i arrived , we were walking outside .
something important happened .
we heard someone pumping water .
i put helen 's hand under the cool water and formed the word w-a-t-e-r in her other hand .
w-a-t-e-r , w-a-t-e-r. .
i formed the word again and again in her hand .
helen looked straight up at the sky as if a lost memory or thought of some kind was coming back to her .
suddenly , the whole mystery of language seemed clear to her .
i could see that the word w-a-t-e-r meant something wonderful and cool that flowed over her hand .
the word became alive for her .
it awakened her spirit , gave it light and hope .
she ran toward the house .
i ran after her .
one by one she touched things and asked their name .
i told her .
she went on asking for names and more names .
from that time on helen left the house each day , searching for things to learn .
each new name brought new thoughts .
everything she touched seemed alive .
one day , helen remembered a doll she had broken .
she searched everywhere for the pieces .
she tried to put the pieces together but could not .
she understood what she had done and was not happy .
miss sullivan taught helen many things -- to read and write , and even to use a typewriter .
but most important , she taught helen how to think .
for the next three years , helen learned more and more new words .
all day miss sullivan kept touching helen 's hand , spelling words that gave helen a language .
in time , helen showed she could learn foreign languages .
she learned latin , greek , french and german .
helen was able to learn many things , not just languages .
she was never willing to leave a problem unfinished , even difficult problems in mathematics .
one time , miss sullivan suggested leaving a problem to solve until the next day .
but helen wanted to keep trying .
she said , " i think it will make my mind stronger to do it now . "
helen traveled a lot with her family or alone with miss sullivan .
in eighteen eighty-eight , helen , her mother and miss sullivan went to boston , massachusetts .
they visited the perkins institution where miss sullivan had learned to teach .
they stayed for most of the summer at the home of family friends near the atlantic ocean .
in helen 's first experience with the ocean , she was caught by a wave and pulled under the water .
miss sullivan rescued her .
when helen recovered , she demanded , " who put salt in the water ? "
three years after helen started to communicate with her hands , she began to learn to speak as other people did .
she never forgot these days .
later in life , she wrote :
no deaf child can ever forget the excitement of his first word .
only one who is deaf can understand the loving way i talked to my dolls , to the stones , to birds and animals .
only the deaf can understand how i felt when my dog obeyed my spoken command .
those first days when helen keller developed the ability to talk were wonderful .
but they proved to be just the beginning of her many successes .
" avatar " makes movie history thanks to 3d technology
twelve years ago , writer-director james cameron made titanic , an epic romance that became the highest-grossing film in hollywood history .
he is making cinema history again with groundbreaking new 3d technology that puts audiences in the middle of his new science fiction adventure set on another world and 150 years in the future .
here 's a look at avatar .
jake sully is a wounded warrior : a u.s. marine paralyzed from a battlefield injury .
the chance to walk again is what initially draws him to a distant , dangerous moon .
you are not in kansas anymore .
you 're on pandora .
out there beyond that fence every living thing that crawls , flies or squats in the mud wants to kill you and eat your eyes for jujubes .
it seems pandora is the only place in the galaxy with deposits of a valuable new energy source worth untold millions back on earth .
to get it , however , they have to go through ... or get rid of ... the pandora natives : a tall , blue-skinned tribe called the navi .
that 's where jake and his colleagues come in :
me and norm are here to " drive " these remotely controlled bodies called avatars .
they are grown from human dna mixed with the dna of the natives .
with his mind electronically linked to his avatar body , jake not only can walk again and survive in the toxic atmosphere of pandora , he can also make direct contact with the navi .
that does n't exactly go well at first .
but as the exotically beautiful neytiri teaches jake about the navi and their connection to their world , he becomes convinced that the exploitation by his fellow humans must be stopped .
new zealander sam worthington plays jake and new jersey native zoe saldana is neytiri .
canadian-born cameron spent years developing a performance capture ' technology for their avatar characters .
the actors wear high-tech outfits dotted with sensors that record their every movement including the subtlest facial expressions .
" the whole thing we were trying to develop was about keeping alive and without any dilution the actors ' work " cameron says .
cameron explains that those captured performances are the key to making computer-generated digital characters that audiences see come " alive " .
i do n't want to be an animator .
i do n't want to try to figure out how to make the characters behave later through animation .
that 's not what i do .
i work with actors , notes cameron .
" my proposal to the actors was : okay , we 're going to be in a room ( and ) we 're going to do this strange thing , but every molecule of what you create will be what your character does .
i want that to be the performance that is seen two years later in the finished film .
cameron also pioneered a realistic 3d technology that requires the audience to wear special glasses ; but sam worthington says it puts them with him in the action .
" you are more endeared to these characters by feeling you are in the fight or the battle or the tragedy with them , " worthington says .
by doing that , the veneer of remembering it is a cg character starts to dissolve and you see the spirit .
we were never going to lose our jobs because the cg character can only work if it is embodied by us and i can tell you that is 100 percent zoe and 100 percent my performance .
it is not a cartoon .
we are not standing at a lectern voicing it .
we had to do it so every jump and smash and roll and smirk and glimmer and kiss we did .
that 's the trick and the magic of this movie that jim and weta digital had to push themselves to get to the point where we forget we are watching big , blue people and we start just rooting for the person inside them .
writer-director cameron also acknowledges that what the humans try to do on the fictional pandora is a clear metaphor for what he believes are the dangers of exploitation on our own planet ; and he believes that is warning science fiction film can deliver :
science fiction can operate on many different levels .
it can operate as a cinema just purely of the visual purely of imagination ; but historically the kind of science fiction that i grew up on had a message , " cameron says .
usually it was a dystopian message in the form of some kind of warning ; and i think that science fiction became more escapist fantasy and less a warning or intellectual medium .
i think that avatar was an attempt to merge science fiction back to its roots of having a warning .
they have sent us a message that they can take whatever they want .
well we will send them a message ... that this is our land !
avatar also features science-fiction veteran sigourney weaver as the scientist who creates the program to learn about and understand the navi .
giovanni ribisi plays the corporate manager of the pandora mining project with stephen lang as the paramilitary commander of the human forces and native american indian actor wes studi is the navi chief .
the soundtrack music is composed by james horner , whose previous collaborations with james cameron include the multiple oscar-winning titanic .

all of the members of the court and his three sons listening attentively because king vuong was known to be the wisest ruler in the whole of asia .
king vuong continued ; " i would like each of you to provide for me a dish of food , you must search for the ingredients and make the dish and serve it to me on the last day of this lunar month , and on the basis of this dish i will decide who is to be the ruler of our kingdom . "
immediately the words had left this king 's mouth , the attendants at the court began to talk in whispers .
they knew that this was a very wise pronouncement of their king because vietnam with its large population and small land area must always give attention to food production to make sure that each person is well fed and healthy .
the three brothers stared in disbelief ; " how could our father suggest such a method of deciding , why does he not test our strength ? " said the first brother .
" why does he not he test our computational skills ? " said the second brother .
the third and youngest brother just looked at the court and his father and made no comment .
within days the two elder brothers had organized their servants and carriages and were racing all over vietnam and even to other parts of south east asia to find the most delectable and delicious ingredients for the dish .
one brother took a boat out into the south china sea to fish for the finest tasting fish , the other went into the khmer mountains to find the most tender boar meat .
yet , prince tiet lieu stayed at home and sat on his front step and pondered his father 's request .
by the end of the lunar month each of the brothers had prepared their dishes and came before the whole of the vietnamese royal court and their wise father king to present it .
the first brother presented a fine porcelain dish of flying fish dressed in a sweet chili sauce and accompanied by costly lotus seeds .
a hush came over the court as the father viewed the dish and placed it on the table .
the second brother came forward and he opened a large copper cauldron and presented a joint of boar dressed with wild mushrooms and a rare wild fern sauce .
again all the court watched the father place the cauldron on the table .
then prince tiet lieu came forward and opened his basket and displayed a large flat rice cake .
the court and his brothers gasped , no-one would dare offer such simple fare to the royal king .
king hung said , " prince tiet lieu , tell me why you have chosen to present me with such a simple rice cake ? "
prince tiet lieu said , " rice is the most precious and valuable of all food found in this kingdom , yet rice is also the most abundant food .
i have prepared a dish that represents my love for you and our beautiful vietnam .
i have cooked it thoroughly then molded it into a round rice cake , and called it banh day as it symbolizes the sky we live under .
i have cooked a square rice cake , stuffed it with cooked bean paste and ground meat in the middle and called it banh chung .
this will symbolize the earth we live on .
as prince tiet lieu spoke his two elder brothers tried to mask the grandness of their dishes as they now understood the wisdom of their younger brother in using ingredients that all the people of vietnam could have access to .
immediately they fell to their knees in front of their father and younger brother and bowed at the same time the whole court bowed to the father and prince tiet lieu as everyone knew that he would make the finest king to rule after his wise father king .
after that , king hung ordered that this recipe be passed out to all people in his kingdom .
as the result , the vietnamese custom is that every year during the new year celebration , the vietnamese people cook banh chung and banh day and use them as special offerings to their ancestors as well as special gifts to relatives and friends during the tet celebrations .
the banh chung is very nutritious , has an original tasty flavor and may be kept for a long time .
all of its ingredients and materials , from the green wrapping leaves to sticky rice and pork , green peas and pepper inside , are all medicines ( according to oriental medicine ) that act to keep harmony between the positive and the negative , thus helping the blood circulate well and preventing diseases .
tết nguyên đán
tết nguyên đán , more commonly known by its shortened name tết , is the most important and popular holiday and festival in vietnam .
it is the vietnamese new year derived from the chinese new year based on the lunar calendar , a lunisolar calendar .
the name tết nguyên đán is sino-vietnamese for feast of the first morning
tết is celebrated on the same day as chinese new year though exceptions arise due to the one-hour time difference between hanoi and beijing .
it takes place from the first day of the first month of the lunar calendar ( around late january or early february ) until at least the third day .
tết shares many of the same customs of its chinese counterpart , having been derived from it .
many vietnamese prepare for tết by cooking special holiday foods and cleaning the house .
there are a lot of customs practiced during tết , like visiting a person 's house on the first day of the new year ( xông nhà ) , ancestral worshipping , wishing new year 's greetings , giving lucky money to children and elderly people , and opening a shop .
tết is also an occasion for pilgrims and family reunions .
during tết , vietnamese visit their relatives and temples , forgetting about the troubles of the past year and hoping for a better upcoming year .
they consider tết to be the first day of spring and the festival is often called hội xuân .
customs
vietnamese people usually return to their families during tết .
some return to worship at the family altar or visit the graves of their ancestors in their homeland .
although tết is a national holiday among all vietnamese , each region and religion has its own customs .
tết in the three vietnamese regions can be divided into three periods , known as tất niên ( before new year 's eve ) , giao thừa ( new year 's eve ) , and tân niên ( the new year ) , representing the preparation before tết , the eve of tết , and the days of and following tết , respectively .
all of these customs are in tết in vietnam .
before new year 's eve
this period begins one or two weeks before tết .
the general atmosphere leading up to tết is in the bustle of shopping , decorating the home , cooking traditional tết food and waiting for relatives to return home .
people try to pay off their debts in advance so that they can be debt-free on tết .
parents buy new clothes for their children so that the children can wear them when tết arrives .
because a lot of commercial activity will cease during the celebrations , people try to stock up on supplies as much as possible .
in the days leading up to tết , the streets and markets are full of people .
as the shops will be closed during tết , everyone is busy buying food , clothes , and decorations for their house .
vietnamese families usually have a family altar , to pay respect to their ancestors .
vietnamese families have a tray of five fruits on their altar called " ngũ quả " , including banana , orange , kumquat , pomelo and finger citron ( some other places have custard apple , coconut , papaya , mango and pineapple ; since it spells out cau , dua , du , xai ) .
each fruit conveys a different meaning .
pomelos promise a lucky and sweet year .
banana and finger citron symbolize a protective hand while kumquats and oranges represent success and prosperity .
during tết the altar is thoroughly cleaned and new offerings are placed there .
traditionally , ông táo , who report to the jade emperor about the events in that house over the past year , return to heaven on the 23rd day of the twelfth month by lunar calendar .
in the days leading up to tết , each family cooks special tet foods such as bánh chưng and bánh dầy .
preparations for these foods are quite extensive .
family members often take turns to keep watch on the fire overnight , telling each other stories about tết of past years .
the new year
the first day is reserved for the nuclear family .
children receive a red envelope containing money from their elders .
this tradition is called mừng tuổi in the north and lì xì in the south .
usually , children wear their new clothes and give their elders the traditional tết greetings before receiving the money .
since the vietnamese believe that the first visitor a family receives in the year determines their fortune for the entire year , people never enter any house on the first day without being invited first .
the act of being the first person to enter a house on tết is called xông đất , xông nhà or đạp đất , which is one of the most important rituals during tết .
according to vietnamese tradition , if good things come to the family on the first day of the lunar new year , the entire following year will also be full of blessings .
usually , a person of good temper , morality and success will be the lucky sign for the host family and be invited first into the house .
however , just to be safe , the owner of the house will leave the house a few minutes before midnight and come back just as the clock strikes midnight to prevent anyone else entering the house first who might potentially bring any unfortunate events in the new year to the household .
sweeping during tết is taboo or unlucky , since it symbolizes sweeping the luck away .
it is also taboo for anyone who experienced a recent loss of a family member to visit anyone else during tết .
during subsequent days , people visit relatives and friends .
traditionally but not strictly , the second day of tết is usually reserved for friends , while the third day is for teachers .
local buddhist temples are popular spots as people like to give donations and to get their fortunes told during tết .
children are free to spend their new money on toys or on gambling games such as bầu cua cá cọp , which can be found in the streets .
prosperous families can pay for dragon dancers to perform at their house .
there are also public performances for everyone to watch .
decorations
traditionally , each family displays cây nêu , an artificial new year tree consisting of a bamboo pole 5 to 6 m long .
the top end is usually decorated with many objects , depending on the locality , including good luck charms , origami fish , cactus branches , etc .
at tết every house is usually decorated by hoa mai – ochna integerrima ( in the central and southern parts of vietnam ) or hoa đào – peach flower ( in the northern part of vietnam ) or hoa ban ( in mountain areas ) .
in the north , some people ( especially the elite in the past ) also decorate their house with a prunus mume tree ( also called mai in vietnamese ) .
in the north or central , the kumquat tree is a popular decoration for the living room during tết .
its many fruits symbolize the fertility and fruitfulness that the family hopes for in the coming year .
vietnamese people also decorate their homes with bonsai and flower plants such as chrysanthemum , marigold symbolizing longevity , mào gà in southern vietnam and paperwhite flower , lavender , hoa bướm in northern vietnam .
in the past , there was a tradition that old people tried to make their paperwhite flowers blossom right the watch-night time .
they also hung up dong ho paintings and thư pháp .
greetings
the traditional greetings are " chúc mừng năm mới " and " cung chúc tân xuân " ( happy new year ) .
people also wish each other prosperity and luck .
common wishes for tết include :
live up to 100 years : used by children for elders .
traditionally , everyone is one year older on tết , so children would wish their grandparents health and longevity in exchange for mừng tuổi or lì xì
security , good health , and prosperity
may a myriad things go according to your will
plenty of health
congratulations and be prosperous
may money flow in like water
food
in vietnam , to celebrate tết is to ăn tết , literally meaning " tết eating " , showing the importance of food in its celebration .
some of the food is also eaten year-round , while other dishes are only eaten during tết .
also , some of the food is vegetarian since it is believed to be good luck to eat vegetarian on tết .
some traditional food on tết are :
bánh chưng and bánh dầy : essentially tightly packed sticky rice with meat or bean fillings wrapped in banana leaves .
bánh chưng ( rectangular ) and bánh gi ầy ( circular ) are symbolically connected with tết and are essential in any tết celebration .
preparation is time-consuming , and can take days to cook .
the story of their origins and their connection with tết is often recounted to children while cooking them overnight .
hạt dưa : roasted watermelon seeds , also eaten during tết .
dưa hành : pickled onion and pickled cabbage .
củ kiệu : pickled small leeks .
mứt : these dried candied fruits are rarely eaten at any time besides tết .
cầu dừa đủ xoài - in southern vietnam , popular fruits used for offerings at the family altar in fruit arranging art are the soursop , coconut , papaya , and mango , since they sound like " cầu vừa đủ xài " , we pray for enough money to spend in the southern dialect of vietnamese .
thịt kho nước dừa meaning " meat stewed in coconut juice " , it is a traditional dish of pork and medium boiled eggs stewed in a broth like sauce made of young coconut juice and nuoc mam .
it is often eaten with pickled bean sprouts and chives , and white rice .
games
people are delighted to enjoy exciting games during tết : bầu cua , cờ tướng , ném còn , chọi trâu , đá gà , marshmallow toss , etc...
they also participate in some competitions presenting their knowledge , strength and aestheticism such as : bird competition and ngâm thơ competition .
people can also visit fortune tellers , in temples and in the streets , to have their fortunes .
you must know your zodiac sign and the star you were born under to have your fortune read .
customs and taboos
these customs come from traditions passed from generation to generation and have become standard .
because of the idea that the beginning will affect the middle and the end of the year , vietnamese people avoid doing bad things and try to do good things during tết holiday .
dos
one should give people lucky presents to enhance the relationship between themselves and others : new clothes , peach branches ( for expelling evil ) , cocks ( wishing for good manners ) , new rice ( wishing for being well-fed ) , rice wine in a gourd ( wishing for a rich and comfortable life ) , bánh chưng ( or bánh tét ) and bánh dày which symbolize sky and earth ( for worshipping the ancestors ) , red things ( red symbolizes happiness , luckiness , advantages ) like watermelon , dogs ( the bark – gâu gâu – sounds like the word giàu - richness in vietnamese language ) , medicated oil ( dầu in vietnamese , also sounds similar to giàu ) .
one should give lucky dong ho paintings such as : " gà đàn " ( wishing for having many children ) , or " vinh hoa " , but should not give unlucky dong ho paintings like " đánh ghen " related to legal proceedings .
one should buy a lot of water for tết , because people wish for money to flow like water currents in a stream ( proverb : " tiền vô như nước " ) .
one should sprinkle lime powder around the house to expel evil .
one should return all things borrowed , and pay debts before tết .
don'ts
one should n't say or do bad things during tết .
one should n't hurt or kill animals or plants but should set them free .
the reason for this originates from buddhism 's causality .
one should n't sweep the house or empty out the rubbish to avoid luck and benefits going with it , especially on the first day of the new year .
one should n't let the broom in confusion if people do n't want it to be stolen .
one should n't give these presents to others : clock or watch ( the recipient 's time is going to pass ) , cats ( mèo in vietnamese language pronounced like nghèo , poverty ) , medicine ( the receiver will get ill ) , cuttle fish ( its ink is black , an unlucky colour ) , writing ink ( for the same reason ) , scissors or knives ( they bring incompatibility ) .
one should n't have duck meat because it brings unluckiness .
one should n't have shrimp in case one would move backwards like shrimp , in other words , one would not succeed .
one should n't buy or wear white clothes because white is the colour of funerals in vietnam .
one should n't let the rice-hulling mill go empty because it symbolizes failed crops .
one should n't refuse anything others give or wish you during tết .
st. valentine 's story
let me introduce myself , my name is valentine .
i lived in rome during the third century .
that was long , long ago !
at that time , rome was ruled by an emperor named claudius .
i did n't like emperor claudius , and i was n't the only one !
a lot of people shared my feelings .
claudius wanted to have a big army .
he expected men to volunteer to join .
many men just did not want to fight in wars .
they did not want to leave their wives and families .
as you might have guessed , not many men signed up .
this made claudius furious .
so what happened ?
he had a crazy idea .
he thought that if men were not married , they would not mind joining the army .
so claudius decided not to allow any more marriages .
young people thought his new law was cruel .
i thought it was preposterous !
i certainly was n't going to support that law !
did i mention that i was a priest ?
one of my favorite activities was to marry couples .
even after emperor claudius passed his law , i kept on performing marriage ceremonies -- secretly , of course .
it was really quite exciting .
imagine a small candlelit room with only the bride and groom and myself .
we would whisper the words of the ceremony , listening the steps of soldiers .
one night , we did hear footsteps .
it was scary !
thank goodness the couple i was marrying escaped in time .
i was caught .
not quite as light on my feet as i used to be , i guess .
i was thrown in jail and told that my punishment was death .
i tried to stay cheerful .
and do you know what ?
wonderful things happened .
many young people came to the jail to visit me .
they threw flowers and notes up to my window .
they wanted me to know that they , too , believed in love .
one of these young people was the daughter of the prison guard .
her father allowed her to visit me in the cell .
sometimes we would sit and talk for hours .
she helped me to keep my spirits up .
she agreed that i did the right thing by ignoring the emperor laws and going ahead with the secret marriages .
on the day i was to die , i left my friend a little note thanking her for her friendship and loyalty .
i signed it , " love from your valentine " .
i believe that note started the custom of exchanging love messages on valentine 's day .
it was written on the day i died , february 14 , 269 a.d .
now , every year on this day , people remember valentine .
but most importantly , they think about love and friendship .
and when they think of emperor claudius , they remember how he tried to stand in the way of love , and they laugh -- because they know that love can n't be beaten !

the color of rose you select means different things .
red is for passion , perfect for the hot young couple who is just getting into their affair , pink is romance , ideal for chaste pairs and married couples , or anyone who is just in love .
stay away from yellow , these ones mean friendship and are n't very romantic at all !
2 . tulips .
tulips traditionally mean " perfect love " and are really a great alternative to the rose .
tulips come in a variety of hues , so it is pretty easy to find one that comes in your lover 's favorite color , even if that 's black .
this simple flower really symbolizes the perfection of your love , with its sculpted petals and beautiful cup .
a simple bouquet of three or five tulips is ideal to give to your darling this valentine 's day .
3 . lilies .
these elegant flowers are stunning when presented alone or in a cluster .
they are come in several colors , including red , white and yellow and symbolize beauty ... just right for letting your girl know how lovely you consider her to be .

5 . carnations .
another fairly traditional flower is the carnation .
they are frilly and feminine and come in hues like pink , white , and red , as well as more stunning shades of purple , green and even blue .
some carnations even have dual colors , with the outer edge of the petals in red or pink while the main flower is white .
carnations can be quite stunning , but tend to be the cheaper of the flowers available .
these flowers last longer than most , up to 3 weeks after they 've been cut .
6 . orchids .
the meanings of this delicate flower are many , including seduction , love , beauty and refinement .
though often quite pricey , a single orchid can be a lovely way to tell someone that you care about them and is considered to be quite romantic .
plus , it 's about as far from the traditional rose as you can get !
7 . wildflowers .
this is more a variety of flower than a specific kind .
there are literally thousands of different wildflowers growing in fields and yards across the country .
what makes this so romantic is that you have to actually go out and take the time to select and pick the flowers for your sweetheart .
giving wildflowers for valentine 's day is sure to impress your girl as it is a very romantic gesture .
in general valentines day flowers are a romantic gift , but these flowers hold more romantic connotations than others .

some 3,000 local residents attended the huyen tran temple festival which kicked off on february 21 at the complex of temples in the central city of hue 's ngu phong mountain to worship huyen tran princess and her father , king tran nhan tong ( 1308 ) .
deputy president nguyen thi doan joined a ritual ceremony and lit incense to pray for peace , prosperity in this new lunar year of the tiger .
the prayers and rituals were conducted by hundreds of buddhist monks and nuns at this temple of king tran nhan tong .
the ceremony was also attended by hundreds of officials from hanoi , hcm city , da nang and the provinces of quang binh , quang tri and quang nam .
hue province first hosted the huyen tran temple festival in 2008 .
this year 's festival is part of activities held by the province to celebrate the 1,000th anniversary of thanglong hanoi .
phan tien dung , director of the provincial department of culture , tourism and sports said the festival reminds people of the princess 's contribution and offers a chance to pray for peace .
participants played folk games and visited an exhibition which displays local traditional handicraft products including bronze and wood carving , embroidery , incense and conical palm-leaf hat making .
the festival also include a conference on the role of women in preserving national culture , an orchestral performance of songs featuring hue city , a flower contest , and a kungfu performance .
the festival proves a popular pilgrimage for buddhist followers in hue and neighbouring areas as king tran nhan tong became a buddhist monk and his daughter a nun in the last period of their lives .
management of spring festivals needs improvement
the organisation and management of vietnam 's spring festivals needs to do a job of preserving and promoting national cultural identity in the spirit of the doi moi process .
spring is festival season in vietnam , attracting crowds of people from all over the world .
for the vietnamese , the festivals are an indispensable part of their spiritual and cultural life .
our reporter talked to vuong duy bao , deputy head of the culture department of the ministry of culture , sports and tourism about the organisation and management of vietnam 's spring festivals .
reporter : going on a pilgrimage and taking part in festivals early in the lunar new year is a vietnamese tradition .
managing festivals properly to keep them in line with cultural traditions is a matter of great importance .
is there anything new in this year 's festival management ?
mr bao : according to the ministry of culture , sports and tourism , vietnam has 7,966 festivals , divided into five categories : folklore , revolutionary history , religion , foreign culture and culture , sports and tourism .
culture , sports and tourism festivals are a new festive form , which has developed rapidly since vietnam 's international integration .
to prepare for the 2010 festivals , the party central committee 's propaganda has asked media agencies and culture , sports and tourism departments throughout the country to discourage public behaviour damaging to vietnam 's scenic beauty or natural environment .
early this year , the ministry of culture , sports and tourism instructed relevant agencies to work hard to ensure a safe and healthy celebration of the lunar new year festival and major national events .
on january 22 , the ministry held online conferences in hanoi , hcm city and danang on festival management in 2010 .
on feb 3 , the ministry issued instruction no 16 on managing religious activities at relicsites .
reporter : of the festival categories , folklore festivals and culture , sports and tourism festivals have become controversial issues .
why is that ?
mr bao : an abrupt increase in the number of tourists , particularly in the north , has caused difficulties for management agencies .
several folklore festivals , which have been diluted or changed in form , have failed to reflect national identity .
in addition , charity boxes , trays , plates and donation solicitations have become a common occurrence at many relic sites , undermining their spiritual aspect .
despite the strong development of culture , sports and tourism festivals around the country , many of these are held in an uninspired way without any local cultural flavour .
these problems are partly due to overcrowding at the festivals .
increasing numbers of visitors are overloading limited venues leading to disorder , traffic jams and retailers jacking up their prices , all of which leaves a blot on the festival .
another problem is the inefficient use of the ministry 's festival budget .
many traditional festivals last too long and do not feature any specific cultural identity .
reporter : how did the ministry direct localities to organise and manage their festivals ?
mr bao : the ministry has asked its member agencies , to do a better job of publicizing the significance of each festival and honouring the individuals who are worshiped at the relic sites .
the managing boards of relics must play down the donation boxes to avoid commercializing relics .
the ministry has authorized cultural departments at root levels to develop a website to introduce festivals to help people both here and abroad gain a better understanding of the festivals .
these departments will also help the ministry complete circulars , regulations regarding weddings , funerals and festivals .
reporter : how is the website on festivals being built ?
mr bao : building the festivals began in 2008 .
we are collecting information about festivals across the country and translating this information into english .
the ministry has also authorised the national cultural heritage department to organise a seminar to identify who will manage the board of relics and landscapes and how relevant agencies can control and use relic donations more effectively .
reporter : what advice do you have for people attending the festivals ?
mr bao : they should learn more about the traditional festivals , follow their regulations , and be environmentally conscious .
the traditional festivals play an important part in the national industrialisation and modernisation process .
therefore , improve festival organisation and management to preserve and promote national cultural identity in line with the spirit of doi moi .
reporter : thank you very much .

the history of titanic disaster
the ship of dreams
the royal mail ship titanic was the last grand dream of the gilded age .
it was designed to be the greatest achievement of an era of prosperity , confidence and propriety .
although no one knew it , the world was about to change drastically .
radio had been invented in 1901 .
the wright brothers ' first successful flight was in 1903 .
the old presumptions about class , morals , and gender-roles were about to be shattered .
if the concept of titanic was the climax of the age , then perhaps its sinking was the curtain that marked the end of the old drama , and the start of a new one .
the plan of titanic
the intensely competitive transatlantic steamship business had seen recent major advances in ship design , size and speed .
white star line , one of the leaders , determined to focus on size and elegance rather than pure speed .
in 1907 , white star line 's managing director j. bruce ismay and lord james pirrie , a partner in harland wolff ( white star line 's ship-builder since its founding in 1869 ) conceived of three magnificent steam ships which would set a new standard for com fort , elegance , and safety .
the first two were to be named olympic and titanic , the latter name chosen by ismay to convey a sense of overwhelming size and strength .
it took a year to design the two ships .
construction of olympic started in december , 1908 , followed by titanic in march 1909 .
the belfast shipyards of harland wolff had to be re-designed to accommodate the immense projects while white star 's pier in new york had to be lengthened to enable the ships to dock .
during the two years it took to complete titanic 's hull , the press was primed with publicity about the ship 's magnificence , making titanic virtually a legend before her launch .
the " launch " of the completed steel in may , 1911 , was a heavily publicized spectacle .
tickets were sold to benefit a local children 's hospital .
she was then taken for " fitting out " which involved the construction of the ship 's many facilities and systems , her elaborate woodwork and fine decor .
as the date of her maiden voyage approached , the completed olympic suffered a collision and required extensive repairs , increasing the workload at harland wolff , which was already struggling to complete titanic on schedule .
titanic 's maiden voyage was delayed from march 20 to april 10 .
the ship
titanic was 883 feet long ( 1.6 of a mile ) , 92 feet wide and weighed 46,328 tons .
she was 104 feet tall from keel to bridge , almost 35 feet of which were below the waterline ... even so , she stood taller above the water than most urban buildings of the time .
there were three real smoke-stacks ; a fourth , dummy stack was added largely to increase the impression of her gargantuan size and power and to vent smoke from her numerous kitchens and galleys .
she was the largest movable object ever made by man .
the ship 's immense size and complexity is illustrated by an incident recalled by second officer lightoller .
there was a gangway door on the starboard side aft " large enough to drive a horse and cart through . "
yet three officers who joined the ship during her preparations spent a whole day simply trying to find their way to it .
moreover , she was designed to be a marvel of modern safety technology .
she had a double-hull of 1-inch thick steel plates and a system of 16 water-tight compartments , sealed by massive doors which could be instantly triggered by a single electric switch on the bridge , or even automatically by electric water-sensors .
the press began to call her " unsinkable . "
her accommodations were the most modern and luxurious on any ocean , and included electric light and heat in every room , electric elevators , a swimming pool , a squash court , a turkish bath , a gymnasium with a mechanical horse and mechanical camel to keep fit , and staterooms and first class facilities to rival the best hotels on the continent .
first class passengers would glide down a six-story , glass-domed grand staircase to enjoy haute cuisine in the sumptuous first class dining saloon that filled the width of the ship on d deck .
for those who desired a more intimate atmosphere , titanic also offered a stately à la carte restaurant , the chic palm court and verandah restaurant , and the festive cafe parisien .
she offered two musical ensembles of the best musicians on the atlantic , many of them lured from rival liners .
there were two libraries , first - and second-class .
even the third class ( steerage ) cabins were more luxurious than the first class cabins on some lesser steamships , and boasted amenities ( like indoor toilet facilities ) that some of titanic 's emigrant passengers had not enjoyed in their own homes .
the original design called for 32 lifeboats .
however , white star management felt that the boat-deck would look cluttered , and reduced the number to 20 , for a total life-boat capacity of 1178 .
this actually exceeded the regulations of the time , even though titanic was capable of carrying over 3500 people ( passengers and crew ) .
the voyage of titanic
the maiden voyage lured the " very best people : " british nobility , american industrialists , the very cream of new york and philadelphia society .
it also attracted many poor emigrants , hoping to start a new life in america or canada .
the journey began at southampton on wednesday april 10 , 1912 at noon .
by sundown , titanic had stopped in cherbourg , france to pick up additional passengers .
that evening she sailed for queenstown , ireland , and at 1:30 pm on thursday , april 11 , she headed out into the atlantic .
the seasoned transatlantic passengers were deeply impressed by the new ship .
she was so massive that they barely felt the movement of the sea at all .
her huge , powerful engines produced almost none of the annoying vibration common on other steamers , and their noise was barely perceptible .
and she achieved this extraordinary level of comfort while traveling at 22 knots , not the fastest boat on the route , but certainly one of the top five .
weather was pleasant and clear , and the water temperature was about 55 degrees .
the winter of 1912 had been unusually mild , and unprecedented amounts of ice had broken loose from the arctic regions .
titanic was equipped with marconi 's new wireless telegraph system and her two marconi operators kept the wireless room running 24 hours a day .
on sunday , april 14 , the fifth day at sea , titanic received five different ice-warnings , but the captain was not overly concerned .
the ship steamed ahead at 22 knots , and the line 's managing director j. bruce ismay relished the idea of arriving in new york a day ahead of schedule .
the new disaster was born
on the night of april 14 , wireless operator phillips was very busy sending chatty passenger 's messages to cape race , newfoundland , whence they could be relayed inland to friends and relatives .
he received a sixth ice-warning that night , but did n't realize how close titanic was to the position of the warning , and put that message under a paperweight at his elbow .
it never reached captain smith or the officer on the bridge .
by all accounts , the night was uncommonly clear and dark , moonless but faintly glowing with an incredible sky full of stars .
the stars were so bright that one officer mistook the planet jupiter ( then rising just above the horizon ) for a steamship light .
the sea was , likewise , unusually calm and flat , " like glass " said many survivors .
the lack of waves made it even more difficult to spot icebergs , since there was no telltale white water breaking at the edges of the bergs .
at 11:40 , a lookout in the crow 's nest spotted an iceberg dead ahead .
he notified the bridge and first officer murdoch ordered the ship turned hard to port .
he signaled the engine room to reverse direction , full astern .
the ship turned slightly , but it was much too large , moving much too fast , and the iceberg was much too close .
37 seconds later , the greatest maritime disaster in history began.
during that night of heroism , terror and tragedy , 705 lives were saved , 1502 lives were lost , and many legends were born .
sir alex ferguson hopes for wigan favour
manchester united manager sir alex ferguson is hopeful that wigan can get a result at chelsea to turn the premier league title race in his side 's favour .
united 's 1-0 win at sunderland ensured the crown will be won on the final day of the season on sunday when his team host stoke and wigan visit chelsea .
" i would n't say it 's a sealed result against wigan by any shadow of a doubt , " said ferguson .
" they 're a good team , they 'll have a go and you never know .
it 's a crazy game .
ferguson did concede he might be " clutching at straws " and added : " manchester city did us a great turn when they beat chelsea twice .
wigan are neighbours too .
" all we can do is win our home game .
we want to win in front of our fans on the last day of the season . "
chelsea 's 2-0 victory at liverpool earlier in the day meant united had to beat sunderland to keep their title hopes realistically alive and they did so , thanks to a first-half nani strike .
but the blues remain favourites to win their first title since 2006 and end united 's run of three in a row .
even before united 's win , chelsea boss carlo ancelotti felt the title race would go down to the wire but he was happy with his side 's form after a comfortable victory at anfield .
phelan admits man utd are underdogs for title
" it was an important performance .
there was a lot of pressure on this game and on us but we had a good control of our emotion , " said the italian coach , seeking to win the title in his first season in england .
" i always said the title would be decided at the end of the season and i still think so .
now the team is fit and showing good personality we have to train for a week and wait .
wigan manager roberto martinez promises to push chelsea
wigan boss roberto martinez has assured manchester united his side will be no pushovers when they take on title-chasing chelsea on sunday .
wigan stand between the blues and the premier league crown , with chelsea a point ahead of united , who face stoke and will be hoping wigan draw or win .
" we will prepare in the best possible manner as we know it is a tough place to go , " martinez told bbc sport .
" but i can guarantee everyone that we will give our best . "
wigan are safe from relegation ahead of the final fixture of the season .
however , victory could result in them moving up one place to 14th in the table , thereby earning an extra £750,000 in prize money from the premier league .
martinez 's men are also looking to do the double over chelsea , having beaten them 3-1 at the dw stadium earlier in the season .
wigan have also beaten liverpool and arsenal this term but have been dreadfully inconsistent , with defeats against the likes of west ham , portsmouth and hull helping towards a season largely spent in the lower reaches of the table .
" we know that not many people will expect us to go there and get a result , " conceded martinez after seeing his side draw 2-2 with hull on monday .
" but this season we have shown that on our day we can go and get a result against anyone .
we will enjoy the experience because for our young players it will be a unique moment .
" if we can do the double then that would be some achievement and i think the players are ready for that sort of challenge . "
and united manager sir alex ferguson hopes the latics can pull off another big result and do his side a favour on sunday .
" i would n't say it 's a sealed result against wigan by any shadow of a doubt , " stated ferguson .
" they 're a good team , they 'll have a go and you never know .
it 's a crazy game . "
chelsea have a significantly better goal difference than united , who are chasing their fourth successive league title .
manchester united 's alex ferguson commends chelsea 's carlo ancelotti
manchester united boss is adamant that his team will return stronger next year .
manchester united manager sir alex ferguson has congratulated carlo ancelotti and chelsea for winning the premier league this season .
even though united cruised to a 4-0 win over stoke city , but chelsea 's 8-0 thrashing of wigan athletic gave the blues the title and ended the red devils ' hopes of winning a fourth consecutive league championship .
ferguson has applauded ancelotti and his team on a great achievement , but insists that united will come back stronger next year .
" this is the hardest league in the world to win and we applaud chelsea for winning it , " ferguson told the sun .
" we have won it the last three years so we know how hard it is .
so i congratulate carlo who is a good manager and a good guy .
of course we 'll be back next year - that is what manchester united do .
" next year we will go again and try and bring back the title to the best place in the world . "
even though united narrowly missed out on a record 19th league title this season , ferguson still considers his side 's champions league quarter-final exit at the hands of bayern munich as the red devils ' biggest disappointment of the season .
" i look at the european cup and that was a big disappointment .
we should have been in the final because we were the better team and just did not have the luck on the night . "
ferguson has no trouble expecting the best out of his united team every season , even though the premier league has become more difficult to win .
" it is a tougher and more competitive league nowadays and it is not easy to impose the kind of football we all want to see against every opposing team .
" there is a great expectancy at manchester united.
i have no problem with that demand , but we should remember that when i arrived at old trafford , liverpool were winning the championship on a regular basis while we had gone 20 years without the title .
we changed all that . "
top 20 unsolved mysteries ( part 1 )
this list comprises the most famous unsolved mysteries known to man that really defy rational explanation or are just strange .
1 . shroud of turin
the shroud of turin is a linen cloth bearing the image of a man who had apparently died of crucifixion .
most catholics consider it to be the burial shroud of jesus christ .
it is currently held in the cathedral of st john the baptist in turin , italy .
despite many scientific investigations , no one has yet been able to explain how the image has been imprinted on this shroud and despite many attempts , no one has managed to replicate it .
radiocarbon tests date it to the middle ages , however apologists for this shroud believe it is incorrupt – and carbon dating can only date things which decay .
prior to the middle ages , reports of the shroud exist as the image of edessa – reliably reported since at least the 4th century .
in addition , another cloth ( the sudarium ) known even from biblical times ( john 7 ) which is said to have covered christ’s head in his tomb .
a 1999 study by mark guscin , a member of the multidisciplinary investigation team of the spanish center for sindonology , investigated the relationship between this two cloths .
based on history , forensic pathology , blood chemistry ( the sudarium also is reported to have type ab blood stains ) , and stain patterns , he concluded that the\is two cloths covered the same head at two distinct , but close moments of time .
avinoam danin ( a researcher at the hebrew university of jerusalem ) concurred with this analysis , adding that the pollen grains in the sudarium match those of the shroud .
2 . mary celeste

in 1997 congress directed scientists and observers from some of the most prestigious research institutes in the nation to look into a strange low frequency noise heard by residents in and around the small town of taos , new mexico .
for years those who had heard this noise , often described by them as a " , had been looking for answers .
to this day no one knows the cause of the hum .

7 . jack the ripper
in the later half of 1888 , london was terrorised by a series of murders in the east end ( largely in the whitechapel area ) .
the name jack the ripper was taken from a letter sent to a newspaper at the time by someone claiming to be the killer .
the victims were typically prostitutes who had their throats cut and bodies mutilated .
in some cases , bodies were discovered just minutes after the ripper had left the scene .
the police at that time had many suspects but could never find sufficient evidence to convict anyone .

he killed at least five people , and injured two .
he comitted the first two murders with a pistol , just inside the benecia border .

40 minutes later the police received an anonymous phone from a man claiming to be their killer and admitting to the murders of the previous two victims .
one month three letters were sent to newspapers in california containing a cypher that the killer claimed would give them his name .
the cypher was decrypted to read :
while arthur leigh allen was the prime suspect , all of the evidence was against him being the killer .
to this day the zodiac murders have not been solved .
10 . the babushka lady
during the analysis of the film footage of the assasination of john f. kennedy in 1963 , a mysterious woman was spotted .
she was wearing a brown overcoat and a scarf on her head ( the scarf is the reason for her name as she wore it in a similar style to russian grandmothers – also called babushkas ) .
this woman appeared to be holding something in front of her face which is believed to be a camera .
she appears in many photos of the scene .
even after the shooting when most people had fled this area , she remained in place and continued to film .
shortly after she is seen moving away to the east up elm street .
the fbi publically requested that the woman come forward and give them the footage she shot but she never did .
in 1970 a woman called beverly oliver came forward and claimed to be the babushka woman , though her story contains many inconsistencies .
she is generally regarded as a fraud .
to this day , no one knows who the babushka woman is or what she was doing there .
more unusual is her refusal to come forward to offer her evidence .
benefits of laughter
author chuck gallozzi
angels fly because they take themselves lightly ( g k chesterton )
plato 's remark that " even the gods love jokes . " must be correct , for the value of laughter is recorded in sacred scripture .
for example , the koran states that " he deserves paradise who makes his companions laugh . "
by the fourteenth century , the healing power of humor was recognized by the medical community .
a good french surgeon , henri de mondeville ( 1320 ) , wrote , " let the surgeon take care to regulate the whole regimen of the patient 's life for joy and happiness , allowing his relatives and special friends to cheer him , and by having someone tell him jokes . "
however , extensive research on 'laughter therapy " did not begin until after the new england journal of medicine published an article by norman cousins in 1976 .
later , in 1979 , this article became the first chapter of his book , ' anatomy of an illness . "
in this book he explained how he was diagnosed in 1964 with ankylosing spondylitis ( also known as spondylitis , or bechterew disease ) .
this disease usually results in acute inflammation of the spine and can affect other areas of the body as well .
norman cousins ' so severe that he was given a one in five hundred chances of recovery and a few months to live .
realizing that negative thoughts and attitudes can result in illness , he reasoned that positive thoughts and attitudes may have the opposite effect .
so he left the hospital and checked into a hotel where he took megadoses of vitamin c and watched humorous movies shows , including ' candid camera " and the marx brothers .
he found that ten minutes of boisterous laughter resulted in at least two hours of free sleep .
he continued this routine until he recovered .
thus , he proved that laughter is the best medicine , and pointed to body medicine .
william fry , d , professor of psychiatry at stanford university medical school , expert on health and laughter , reports the average kindergarten student laughs 300 times a day .
yet , adults average just 17 laughs a day .
why the difference ?
are we too uptight , too tense ?
do we take life too seriously ?
isn't it time we learned how to relax ?
we don't stop laughing because we grow old ; we grow old because we stop laughing .
so , if we want to fly like the angels and share in their happiness , we 'll have to follow their example and take ourselves lightly .
our five senses are not enough for ideal living .
we need to use our sixth sense : our sense of humor .
humor isn't about merely telling jokes ; it 's the way we view the world .
we can be sincere about life without taking it so seriously .
we can laugh about our mistakes and pain .
louis kronenberger explains : " humor simultaneously wounds and heals , indicts and pardons , diminishes and enlarges ; it constitutes inner growth at the expense of outer gain . "
the brilliant american humorist , james thurber ( 1961 ) , described humorists as follows : " the wit makes fun of other persons ; the satirist makes fun of the world ; the humorist makes fun of himself , but in so doing , he identifies himself with people - that is , people everywhere , not for the purpose of taking them apart , but revealing their true nature . "
the wellspring of laughter is not happiness , but pain , stress , and suffering .
socrates pointed this out when he taught , " the comic and the tragic inseparably close , like light and shadow . "
so , we should be thankful for our suffering , for without it there would be nothing to laugh at !
when we laugh at our woes , they dissolve , or at least become bearable , so that we arrive at peace and happiness .
as the pragmatic philosopher and psychologist , william james ( 1910 ) , said , " we don't laugh because we 're happy , we are happy because we laugh . "
what 's the reason behind this article ?
simply to point out the benefits of laughter are too numerous to ignore .
now is the time to resolve that we will make an effort to laugh frequently throughout the day .
of course , as we do so , we will laugh with people not at them .
we will laugh at what people do , not at what people are .
we will laugh not only to lighten our burdens , also those of everyone we meet .
the many benefits of laughter
1 . when you make fun of yourself , you disempower those who would make fun of you and disarm possible confrontations .
2 . laughter dissolves tension , stress , anxiety , irritation , anger , grief , and depression .
like crying , laughter lowers inhibitions , allowing the release of up emotions .
after a hearty bout of laughter , you will experience a sense of well-being .
simply put , who laughs , he lasts .
after all , if you can laugh at it , you can live with it .
remember , a person without a sense of humor is like a car without shock absorbers .
3 . medical researches have found that laughter boosts the immune system .
the study of how behavior and the brain affect the immune system is called psycho neuroimmunology .
though still in its infancy , this science is rapidly gaining much attention as mankind strives to understand the body relationship .
4 . laughter reduces pain by releasing endorphins that are more potent than equivalent amounts of morphine .
5 . humor helps integrate both hemispheres of brain , for the left hemisphere is used to decipher the verbal content of a joke while the right hemisphere interprets whether it is funny or not .
6 . laughter adds spice to life ; it may comfort our miserable life .
7 . develop your sense of humor and you will find you are more productive , a better communicator , and a superior team player .
8 . everyone loves someone who can make them laugh .
the more you share your sense of humor , the more friends you will have .
9 . humor brings the balance we need to get through the turbulence of life comfortably .
10 . laughter is even equivalent to a small amount of exercise .
it massages all the organs of the body , according to dr. james walsh .
11 . a sense of humor can help you accept the inevitable , rise to any challenge , handle the unexpected with ease , and come out of any difficulty smiling .
the most wasted day is that in which we have not laughed .
don't wait until you are sick before you begin practicing laughter therapy .
start today by renting comedy classics from video store , borrowing humorous books from the library , attending comedy clubs or watching comics on tv , and exchanging jokes with family members , friends , and coworkers .
if you are visiting someone in the hospital , why not bring funny greeting cards and humorous books instead of flowers ?
every time i 'm out on a cloudy day with a group of friends , i 'm the first person to know when it starts to rain .
do you know why ?
because i 'm bald !
louis van gaal : bayern munich try to play attractive football unlike inter
the dutch tactician criticises " the special one " for his style of play .
bayern munich coach louis van gaal has told the press that he believes jose mourinho doesn't teach his inter how to play attractive football .
the two sides will meet in the champions league final on may 22 .
the nerazzurri played a very defensive leg at the camp nou against barcelona to advance to the final , sparking a wild celebration from mourinho at the time whistle .
" i would not have done what mourinho did at the camp nou , i wouldn't have behaved in a provocative way , " he said in an interview with sport bild .
mourinho worked as van gaal 's assistant at barcelona early in his career .
"his analysis was good , even then you could see he understood football , " he continued .
" but at that time he was very humble and it 's great to see how he has evolved , he gradually became a personality . "
finally , the old commented on mourinho 's style of play , suggesting inter have no desire attractive approach to the game .
" he trains to win , so do i , but i also choose to express good football .
my way is more difficult , " he concluded .

mourinho : toughest season ever
inter milan coach jose mourinho has admitted that winning this season 's scudetto is the toughest feat of his managerial career .
the special one told la gazzetta dello sport that he is used to wrapping up the title before the final day of the season .
it was the toughest scudetto i have ever won .
" we were two points down with five matches .
" i have never fought for the championship on the last day .
i have always wrapped up the title before the last match , and was worried up until the 90th minute that siena could have scored . "
the portuguese also dropped strong hints about his future with the inter milan , stating that italy is not where he calls home .
" italy is not my home .
it is not a country where i can work well . "
he then went on to credit sampdoria for giving a big helping hand to inter 's defence of the scudetto by beating roma during one of the last few matches of the season , allowing mourinho 's side to propel above the rome club in the serie a ladder .
" i was never scared that we would lose .
when we drew with fiorentina in april and roma overtook us , we knew that winning wasn't enough , " added this coach .
" it was sampdoria who helped us out the most , as it was the last opportunity for us to regain the lead in the race .
we have two titles , the others have zero .
i can say this calmly .
with the double already secured under his belt , the special one will now look to lead his side to a treble when inter wrestle with bayern munich in the champions league final .
" an historic week awaits us , where i want to give it everything we have to win .
i want to prepare my team to the best of my abilities , and then i will take a rest , "
he concluded .
that will be the sweetest parting gift he can offer .
five reasons why inter beat bayern munich
1 ) diego milito
it’s not hard to figure out that this old was an important factor , simply by looking at the scoreboard .
you’ll see the argentine’s name not once , but twice as he continued his penchant of scoring in big matches .
his goals clinched all three of inter’s titles this season – the coppa italia , serie a and now the champions league .
president massimo moratti’s dream has been realised in no small part due to his efforts .
at real zaragoza and genoa he proved to be a capable scorer , but at inter he displayed a world-class pedigree at the top level and will hope to carry that into the world cup .
2 ) bayern’s weak defense
milito clincially took both his chances with great aplomb , but also exposed fc hollywood’s backs , a weakness that had been highlighted throughout the season in europe’s top competition , even against manchester united and fiorentina , and an achilles heel that goal com’s ewan macdonald pinpointed before the match .
in the first instance , he beat martin demichelis in the air before playing a go with wesley sneijder and completed his brace when he left daniel van buyten for dead .
3 ) motivation
of course both sides had their motivations , but in reality it may have propelled the beneamata further than the bavarians on the day .
as goal.com's peter staunton reports , mourinho was motivated to defeat former mentor louis van gaal and win the war ’ with italy .
the players were motivated by history – an italian club’s ever treble season and patron massimo moratti motivated to replicate his father ’s success .
eto’o determined to succeed somewhere other than barcelona , lucio resolute in overcoming the side that let him go , sneijder unwavering in his goal to succeed at the santiago bernabeu , the list goes on ...
4 ) selfless style of play
it may not be the most pretty football to watch – arsenal or barcelona will offer you more of a spectacle – but the nerazzurri proved they are the most effective in 2010 by working hard and diligently for one another .
samuel eto’o is a true example , having given up his goalscoring instincts for a spot on the wing , lucio and walter samuel threw their bodies on the line time time again , javier zanetti dug deep to find the energy reserves to cover men , and even maicon curbed his attacking enthusiasm on saturday evening .
5 ) jose mourinho
yes , you all knew this list would end with ‘ the special one .
tactically he was spot on once again – denying bayern space in the attacking , keeping their opportunities to a minimum , and of course ending their hopes – as he did to chelsea , cska moscow and former champions barcelona .
now on his way to real madrid , he leaves a legacy in milan having won a historic treble that the fans will remember for years to come .
his time in serie a was anything but smooth , but in the end it was a boost for himself , the club and the country .
van gaal : inter deserved to win
louis van gaal conceded bayern munich " not good enough " to impose their own game on inter milan in the champions league final .
bayern 's dreams of an trophy treble were crushed in the bernabeu as diego milito scored a goal in each half to earn inter a 2-0 win .
though the german champions dominated possession in madrid , bar a golden chance for thomas muller moments after time they struggled to find a way through inter 's stubborn defence .
van gaal believes there was little to choose between the two teams , but acknowledged that inter deserved a first european cup success in 45 years .
" we were not good enough to impose our game , " said van gaal .
" inter only reacted , but they still won deservedly .
" the timing of the goals was decisive .
the players learned today that it comes down to small details .
" i still have the feeling that we could have won .
there were no great difference .
" we attacked , inter defended , but you have to be in great shape to beat inter and we were not today .
i still think inter merited the win . "
bayern keeper jorg butt echoed van gaal 's sentiments , saying : " they deserved to win . they defended very well .
" we never found our game and could not get past their defence .
they have great strikers . "
captain mark van bommel believes muller 's opportunity , when this youngster shot straight at julio cesar , was a key moment in the game .
van bommel commented : " not the better , but the more effective team won .
" had muller scored , it may have been different .
these are decisive moments .
but no reproaches , muller has scored so many goals this season . "
usa team meets presidents obama and clinton in white house
the president and vice president wished the u.s. team well in the upcoming world cup .
the u.s. national team took a tour of the white house today , meeting president barack obama , former president bill clinton , and vice president joe biden along the way .
the 23-man roster which will travel to south africa to compete in the 2010 world cup on sunday received a guided tour by biden before meeting obama .
clinton is a member of the u.s. bid for the 2018 or 2022 world cup .
" we are privileged to represent the united states in the 2010 fifa world cup , and that honor has been magnified many times over by the welcome we received today by president obama , vice president biden and president clinton at the white house , "
u.s. soccer president sunil gulati said .
"our country ’s leaders clearly understand and appreciate what the world cup means to all people of the world .
the support they’ve shown , along with the american people , for our journey to this historic world cup as well as our bid to host the tournament in 2018 or 2022 has been immense and inspirational . "
on wednesday , u.s. head coach bob bradley sliced his preliminary man roster down to 23 names .
that final list will play one last friendly on u.s. soil on saturday before embarking for south africa .
" it was a great honor for our team to visit the white house and meet president obama , vice president biden and president clinton , "
bradley said .
" we are proud to be representing our country in south africa , and there is no greater way to reinforce that message than to hear it directly from the president of the united states . "
special : world cup politics – when sport and society mix
goal.com 's ewan macdonald looks at how the world 's biggest football tournament and politics collide .
for many , perhaps most , football is an escape .
it 's a chance to lose oneself in entertainment and passion for ninety minutes on a weekend ; to fraternise with likeminded fans ; to celebrate your local pride in style .
yet it 's undeniable that for millions worldwide , football is simply more than that .
what happens on the pitch can collide quite dramatically with other aspects of life , not least politics .
this is true of the club game , where teams founded by workers quickly found themselves exceeding the capabilities of more genteel organisations early in football 's history , and where divisions ranging from the ethnic to the religious to the cultural persist to this day .
but it 's in the realm of international competition that such matters really come to a fore , and nowhere is that more true than in the world cup .
indeed , the world cup itself is built on a political divide of a sort .
the first edition of the competition in 1930 was hosted by uruguay , on the quite reasonable grounds that they had won the last two world amateur titles at the olympics .
but , feeling snubbed , european countries declined to enter .
particularly sniffy were the constituent countries of the united kingdom , not fifa members , who refused to consider membership in this organization , much less the long journey abroad .
in the event four european teams were coaxed across the ocean .
france made history by scoring the first ever world cup goal through lucien laurent , an amateur forward and factory worker .
( that french side was intriguing for all manner of reasons : captain alex villaplane , for example , returned home to become an enthusiastic nazi collaborator before being executed in 1944 . )
in any case , uruguay ( who inevitably won the tournament ) declined to return the favor four years later , boycotting the world cup 's arrival in italy due to the feeling from the poor european showing in their own back yard .
three teams crossed the atlantic ; brazil , argentina and the united states all lost their only matches .
the narrative of the colonized versus the colonizer made little sense in light of the fact that football was not yet the sport of the people - brazil 's representatives came in large part from the do and overwhelmingly white botafogo club - but still the rivalry of europe against the americas came to define much of international football in its early days .
it still does so now , particularly from a south american perspective .
war and peace
as with so much else of civil society , world cup stopped for world war ii .
italy 's win in 1938 – in what was , incidentally , the first tournament to welcome an asian side in the form of the dutch east indies - was the final kick of a fifa ball until 1950 , when tournament play resumed in brazil .
yet despite the fact the war had been over for five years , its repercussions were still felt .
germany , newly partitioned , had two football associations , but neither represented the german east .
one , instead , was in tiny saarland , whose brief but exciting tenure as an international force did not culminate in qualification .
however , their lastminute acceptance showed that , for perhaps the first time , europe was serious about competing in south america , and viceversa .
even the brits were tempted to come along , england winning the home nations championship and take their place .
scotland , at the time a formidable team , declined to attend despite being invited , reasoning that second place did not merit such a reward .
( forward 60 years and one imagines that the scots would feel slightly differently . )
only the withdrawal of india prevented the 1950 world cup from being the truly global event that it promised .
that came later as the lucre and prestige of the cup continued to grow .
for those hoping that greater global acceptance would an end/nn</span> politicking , though , there was to be disappointment .
in fact as the tournament grew in stature in footballing terms , so too it became a global and social commodity .
in other words , the world cup was a big deal , and was thus far more likely to attract pitch attention .
( this they did , brilliantly so , drawing with the much-fancied england and beating austria . )
meanwhile turkey withdrew yet again after being placed , inexplicably , in the asian qualifiers .
this gave their opponents , israel , a bye to the next stage .
in that round neither indonesia nor egypt were able to take part , so israel and sudan - who had beaten syria - moved on to the next and final match .
sudan refused to play against israel for political reasons and thus withdrew from competition altogether .
thus there was israel , the conqueror of asia and africa , alone as a world cup entrant without playing a single game .
fifa decided this was unacceptable , so arranged an impromptu playoff with a random european runner-up , wales .
wales beat the israelis and thus qualified for their one and only world cup .
and all because sudan would n't travel to israel !
such matters only grew in importance as the decades progressed .
in 1966 the world cup came to england for the first time for their only victory ( thus far ) , but did so without facing an african team , all of whom withdrew over fifa 's refusal to grant the continent an automatic place in the tournament .
in 1970 morocco became the first african team in over 30 years to play in a world cup in a bizarre but brilliant tournament that summed up all of football 's foibles – playing in the noonday sun to accommodate european television schedules , for example .
as for 1982 , european alliances came to the fore as west germany and austria contrived to play out a 1-0 win for the former in what will forever be known as the ' shame of gijon ' .
this nonevent was a fixed group match that allowed both the german language-speaking countries to progress to the next stage at the expense of algeria thanks to a complex fixture arrangement – one again created at the behest of television – long since abandoned .
the end result was 1-0 to west germany , as if it matters .
towards the present
most of the political aspects we 've seen so far have been negative , and mainly to do with power or victory .
for a change of pace , consider west germany 's world cup win in 1990 .
the berlin wall had been down for scarcely six months and as the 'nationalelf' roared to victory in italy , east and west were busy sealing the formal road to reunification .
in stark contrast to when the sides met in the 1978 world cup – a tense , fraught event – in this instance the two germanies celebrated the west 's victory together .
that it helped settle some of the reunification nerves and bring a divided people together is undeniable .
it would be an exaggeration to say that reunification could not have happened without football , but it is not a stretch to say that it would not have been so quick .
a cynic might argue , west german elites may have been pleased for the win as it distracted observers from the harsh economic realities of fusion ; even if this is true , it was abundantly plain that football was serving as the force for unity and good that it had all too often forgotten in the past .
the yugoslavia team of such an era , too , had its own role to play .
before the balkans shattered in tragic fashion , the yugoslavs were the pride of eastern europe .
serbs like dragan stojkovic lined up next to croats such as davor suker and bosnian legends including safet susic and zlatko vujovic .
such a team , bringing the best of all cultures together , could well have gone on to be one of the best of all time - young stars such as alen boksic were still in their footballing infancy - but then the war came , and yugoslavia would never again compete as a single entity in world play .
now the balkan states each have their own teams - still , thankfully , punching above their weight , but not as they might have done .
indeed , football itself had its role to play in the dissolution : rivalry between future european champions red star belgrade and dinamo zagreb months before the tournament brought ethnic strife to the forefront of peoples ' minds .
four years later andres escobar , a colombian defender , scored an own goal at the 1994 world cup .
this would have been an unfortunate historical footnote for the stat buff if not for the fact that he was then shot to death upon his return home .
why ?
nobody knows for sure , but in a country such as colombia , in which drug lords hold sway , it has been rumored that massive gambling losses in the underworld was the trigger .
the money and the power , then , that football has provided could have been a major contributing factor .
( as far as the courts determined , however , escobar was simply shot for protesting when a man in a bar ridiculed him for his own goal . )
the world cup went truly global in 2002 with its arrival in east asia , with japan and south korea becoming the first ever co-hosts .
yet four years later an even greater moment of off-pitch drama was to follow .
in 2006 the ivory coast , long since wracked by civil war , saw battling factions put down arms and pick up remote controls for a ceasefire in order to support the ivorians in their first ever crack at world cup play .
it 's easy to romanticize this incident - human rights observers noted that , while conventional war ceased , citizens were still under attack - but at the same time the role of both the sport itself and the personalities involved helped , however slightly the road to peace .
the path ahead
could the same be about to happen now ?
for the first time ever , north and south korea will compete at the same tournament .
the importance of what may occur in south africa cannot be understated .
so much is at stake : the north has in recent months reacted with fury to allegations of its sinking a southern vessel , and diplomatic relations between the two states – hardly ideal at the best of times – have reached a recent nadir .
yet on the sporting arena the countries have a much more love-hate relationship .
true enough , the official news organ of the north essentially accused the south of poisoning their players in the lead-up to a vital qualifier last year , but in 2008 athletes from the two sides marched together at the opening ceremony of the olympic games.
might we see scenes of similar fraternity this year ?
meanwhile there are other countries without troubles to seek .
chile , riven recently by a disastrous earthquake , has taken the world cup team to their hearts in a way that even this football-crazy nation might not have done in years past .
events as innocuous as launching the new national shirt have been greeted with intense fervour ; should chilean hero humberto " chupete ' suazo fail to recover from injury in time for the opening game , the mood of the nation will take a significant downturn .
as for greece , a country cowed and humiliated by its financial disasters and civic un rest , the world cup is a superb chance to prove that this small population can still hold its own , much as they did in the 2004 european championships by pulling off a massively unlikely underdog win .
and that brings us to south africa itself .
the host country has so much riding on this tournament .
fifa do , too .
their mission to bring the tournament to africa is long-standing , and now it 's been achieved : any organizational failing , any security breach , and problem of any kind will have detractors mobilizing in numbers ( and perhaps justifiably so . )
but aside from such concerns , which amount to nickels and dimes , is the future of south africa itself .
under the dreadful apartheid regime the country lived a strange , alone existence .
now , the rainbow nation has a chance to truly prove to the world that it can fulfill its promise .
it 's no exaggeration to say that the opening match of the world cup will be , for all south africans , the most important game of their lives .
if history 's anything to go by , how this one goes both on and off the pitch could determine so much more in years to come .
world cup begins
play has begun at the 2010 world cup - the first ever world cup to be held on the continent of africa .
about 90,000 fans mostly dressed in south africa 's team colors of yellow and green packed into the newly refurbished soccer city stadium in johannesburg on friday .
they watched host south africa battle mexico to a 1 draw in the first game of the nation , long tournament .
france and uruguay play in the second game of the day .
later , france and uruguay played to a scoreless draw at a packed stadium in cape town .
earlier a spectacular opening ceremony featured singers and dancers in colorful costumes and body paint .
television cameras also showed south african nobel laureate - retired archbishop desmond tutu wearing a team jersey and dancing in the stands .
he was joined in the stands by u.s. vice president joe biden who is representing the united states at this tournament .
the excitement was tempered , though , by the absence of former president nelson mandela , who canceled a planned appearance after his great-granddaughter was killed in a car crash on her way home from thursday 's world cup kickoff concert .
in remarks before the start of the game , president zuma said the old mr. mandela had wanted to attend but could not because of the unexpected death of his old great-granddaughter , zenani .
mr. zuma also lauded the tournament as the first ever hosted by an african nation , calling it " the african world cup . "
the world cup is being played in 10 stadiums across south africa , including soccer city and ellis park in johannesburg .
in addition to an automatic qualification for the host team , five african countries qualified for this year 's world cup - ivory coast , ghana , cameroon , nigeria and algeria .
italy enters the world cup as defending champion , but spain , the reigning european champion , and time former world champion brazil are considered the early favorites in south africa .
the first world cup football tournament was played in 1930 in montevideo with host nation uruguay defeating argentina for the championship .

his death was attributed to an overdose of a powerful anesthetic ( propofol ) .
the doctor who administered the drug ( conrad murray ) is facing criminal charges ( involuntary manslaughter ) in connection with jackson 's death .

at new york 's apollo theater on friday , jackson 's music blared from loudspeakers as fans danced in the streets .
his music could also be heard on the streets of gary , indiana , jackson 's hometown , where his mother ( katherine ) and his children ( prince , paris and blanket ) unveiled a michael jackson monument .

sorry blatter to reconsider technology
sepp blatter revealed he has apologized to england and admitted fifa will now be forced to look again at goal-line technology .
lampard 's disallowed goal during england 's 4-1 defeat to germany has led to renewed calls for the introduction of technology .
fifa had ruled this out as recently as saturday - the day before the controversy erupted - but blatter conceded fifa would have to make an about-turn on the issue .
sunday night 's match between argentina and mexico had also thrown up a controversial incident , with carlos tevez scoring the opening goal from a blatantly offside position , but blatter said only goal-line technology would be discussed and not video replays .
the fifa president told a media briefing in johannesburg : " it is obvious that after the experience so far in this world cup it would be a nonsense to not reopen the file of technology at the business meeting of the international fa board in july .
" personally i deplore it when you see evident referee mistakes but it 's not the end of a competition or the end of football , this can happen . "
" they were not five-star games for the referees .
the only thing i can do is yesterday i have spoken to the two federations by referees mistakes .
i have expressed to them apologies and i understand they are not happy and that people are criticising .
" we will naturally take on board the discussion on technology and will have the first opportunity in july at the business meeting . "
blatter added : " it happened in 1966 and then 44 years later - though it was not quite the same .
" i apologised to england and mexico .
the english said thank you and accepted that you can win some and you lose some , and the mexicans bowed their head and accepted it . "
the fifa president added the ifab would not consider video replays of all incidents .
" the only principle we are going to bring back for discussion is goal-line technology . "
" football is a game that never stops .
for situations like the mexico game you do n't need technology .
blatter added that fifa would launch a new drive to improve refereeing standards at the top level later this year .
" we will come out with a new model in november on how to improve high level referees , " he added .
" we will start with a new concept of how to improve match control .
i cannot disclose more of what we are doing but something has to be changed . "
blatter also warned french president nicolas sarkozy risks suspension from football if he interferes in the running of the game in that country .
sarkozy has promised to personally head an investigation into france 's fiasco at the world cup where the players boycotted training and failed to win a match .
fifa rules forbid government interference in the running of national associations and blatter said : " political interference in the national associations will be dealt with by fifa no matter the size of the country .
" french football can rely on fifa in case of political interference even if it 's at the presidential level .
" france made an " affaire d'etat " of football but it remains in the hands of the federation . "
french football federation president jean-pierre escalettes resigned his position yesterday as a result of the world cup controversy .
the facts behind cohabitation
families have changed in the last several decades .
instead of getting married , many people are living together or " cohabiting " .
some of these cohabitating couples eventually get married .
many of them break up .
very few stay together as cohabitants for long .
is cohabitation a good alternative to marriage ?
is cohabitation a good way to ' test out ' the relationship ?
many researchers have looked into these questions .
in her book marriage-lite patricia morgan reviews the research into the results of cohabitation , compared with marriage , and finds that marriage is much more than ' just a piece of paper ' .
marriage fundamentally changes the nature of a relationship , leading to many striking differences .
how cohabitation differs from marriage
living together leads to living alone
in the mid-1960s , only five per cent of single women lived with a man before getting married .
by the 1990s , about 70 per cent did so .
some people think that living together will lead automatically to marriage , but that often is not the case .
many cohabitations break up .
for many other couples , cohabitation is viewed as an alternative to marriage rather than a preparation for it .
however , this alternative is less likely than marriage to lead to a long-term stable commitment .
stability
cohabiting relationships are fragile .
they are always more likely to break up than marriages entered into at the same time , regardless of age or income .
on average , cohabitations last less than two years before breaking up or converting to marriage .
less than four per cent of cohabitations last for ten years or more .
cohabiting also influences later marriages .
the more often men and women cohabit , the more likely they are to divorce later .
cheating
both men and women in cohabiting relationships are more likely to be unfaithful to their partners than married people .
economics
at all socio-economic levels , cohabiting couples accumulate less wealth than married couples .
married men earn 10 to 40 percent more than single or cohabiting men , and they are more successful in their careers , particularly when they become fathers .
married women without children earn about the same as childless single or cohabiting women .
all women who take time out of employment to have children lose some earning power-whether they are married or not .
however , cohabiting and lone mothers often lack access to the father 's income , making it more difficult to balance their caring responsibilities with their careers .
health
cohabitants have more health problems than married people , probably because cohabitants put up with behaviour in their partners which husbands and wives would discou rage , particularly regarding smoking , alcohol and substance abuse .
cohabitants are also much more likely to suffer from depression than married people .
domestic violence
women in cohabiting relationships are more likely than wives to be abused .
in one study , marital status was the strongest predictor of abuse-ahead of race , age , education or housing conditions .
the effects on children
what happens to children born to cohabiting parents ?
some people believe that if a cohabiting couple have children together , then they must be committed and stable .
however , cohabitations with children are even more likely to break up than childless ones .
about 15 percent of one-parent families are created through the break-up of cohabiting unions .
one study found that less than ten percent of women who have their first child in a cohabiting relationship are still cohabiting ten years later .
about 40 centper will have married , 50 percent will be lone unmarried mothers because their relationships have broken up .
today , more than 20 % of children are born to cohabiting couples .
however , only about one third of those children will remain with both their parents throughout their childhood .
that is partly because cohabiting couples who have children are even more likely to break up than childless couples , and partly because cohabiting couples who subsequently marry are more likely to divorce , and to divorce earlier .
all this means that children born to cohabiting parents are more likely to experience a series of disruptions in their family life , which can have negative consequences for their emotional and educational development .
children living with cohabiting couples do less well at school and are more likely to suffer from emotional problems than children of married couples .
financially , children of cohabitants are less well off than children whose parents are married .
married fathers are more likely than cohabiting fathers to support their children .
even after the break-up of their parents ' relationship , children of divorced parents are more likely than children of cohabiting couples who have split up to receive support from their fathers .
unmarried fathers , even those cohabiting with their children 's mother , do not automatically fulfill the same parental duties as married or divorced fathers .
if their parents break up , children born to cohabiting couples are less likely than children of divorced parents to maintain contact with their fathers .
cohabitants as ' step-parents '
when married or cohabiting couples with children divorce , or break up , one parent sometimes remarries or moves in with a new person .
one scholar estimated that , before their seventeenth birthday , more than one in twenty children would live in a formalized step-family where one parent ( usually their moth er ) has remar ried , and over one in fourteen children would live in an informal 'step-family " where their mother is living with someone who has neither a biological nor a legal tie to her child .
statistically speaking , these informal cohabiting step-families are the most unsafe environments for children .
children living in cohabiting step-families are at significantly higher risk of child abuse .
live-in and visiting boyfriends are much more likely than biological fathers or married step-fathers to inflict severe physical abuse , sexual abuse and child killing .
living in a step-family poses other risks to young people .
in one study , young men living in step-families were 1.4 times more likely to be serious or persistent offenders .
private arrangement or public commitment ?
free to choose ?
some people describe cohabitation as a rebellion against traditional family forms , striking a blow for freedom and independence .
while some people do make a conscious choice to avoid marriage , others simply 'drift into ' cohabitation .
many other people live together because it seems the best choice available at the time , even though they see it as far from ideal .
finances might influence people 's choices .
for many people , especially those in low-paid or irregular work , getting married can seem too expensive .
some people also fear that getting married is a high- risk gamble because no-fault divorce laws make it easier for a spouse to walk away from their commitment .
more than ' just a piece of paper '
traditionally , marriage has had a special status in british law and society .
marriage developed as a way to provide stability for families and for all of society .
marriage is a declaration of commitment which has public as well as private consequences .
it is an institution which offers benefits not only to the couples themselves but to society as a whole .
when people marry , they commit themselves not only to being sexual partners , but also to taking care of each other-for richer or for poorer , in sickness and in health .
they promise to stick by each other through the ups and downs that occur in everyone 's lives .
this promise and the trust it builds encourage partners to make sacrifices for the good of the family .
traditionally , british government and society have supported the institution of marriage by giving it certain privileges and responsibilities , and by enforcing consequences for breaking marriage vows .
a decrease in the number of marriages and an increase in cohabitation both have come in the wake of a large increase in divorce in the last thirty years .
some people argue that these trends are due to people being less willing to make commitments , or perhaps being more fearful that others will break their promises .
the role of the state
although a good deal of evidence shows that cohabiting relationships have higher risks of poor outcomes , governmental and other official bodies continue to treat cohabitation and marriage as essentially the same .
for example , the lord chancellor stated that 'the growing acceptance of long-term cohabitation as a preliminary or alternative to marriage ' means that 'many such relationships must be at least as stable as marriage ' .
" the most important thing is the quality of the relationship , not the institution in itself' . "
some people argue that marriage should not receive any special recognition from the state .
they claim that cohabitants should have the same legal rights and responsibilities which used to be reserved for marriage , from property rights to the right to take decisions about children 's lives .
currently , when a married couple divorces , a court decides how to divide their property , based upon the needs of both spouses and any children they have .
however , when a cohabiting couple break up , each person retains ownership of their own property .
this system ensures that individuals who commit themselves to the institution of marriage have some legal protection .
it also protects the freedom of those who choose to live with each other outside the bounds of marriage .
although a marriage always requires two people , a divorce sometimes requires just one person , leaving the other in the cold .
the state could help strengthen the institution of marriage by ending ' no-fault' , non-consensual or unilateral divorce , and by introducing divorce settlements which penalise , rather than fav our , the spouse who leaves or behaves badly .

netherlands attacker robin van persie wants to face germany in the final
the tricky forward has set his sights on a final against germany after netherlands beat uruguay 3-2 .
netherlands withstood a late rally in tuesday 's world cup semifinal to dash uruguay 's world cup dreams .
a first-half strike from giovanni van bronckhorst and two goals in the second period from wesley sneijder and arjen robben were enough to record a 3-2 victory .
attacker robin van persie put in one of his best performances of the tournament so far and was overwhelmed with holland 's success .
the arsenal star did n't get carried away though and was already thinking about the final .
" this is such a great feeling .
reaching the final like this really gives me goosebumps , " said van persie to nos.
" we knew uruguay had a great team as well and that it would n't be an easy game .
they were never going to give up until the referee blew his whistle for the last time .
we held on to our lead though to progress .
" we beat uruguay with some nice attacking play .
we scored three good goals and fought extremely hard for the victory .
reaching the final is like a dream a come true .
it does n't really matter whether we will play against germany or spain .
however , i have a feeling we will play against the germans .
it 'll be a great challenge anywa y .
dancing with the stars to feature same-sex couple
israel 's version of dancing with the stars is to include the show 's first same-sex couple in the new series .
tv presenter gili shem tov , who has a female partner in real life , said dancing with another woman felt " natural " to her .
she will be partnered with professional dancer dorit milman when the show 's sixth season begins on 1 november .
the couple will take it in turns to take on the traditional male role of leading the dances .
dance professional milman , who is heterosexual , has appeared on the programme since its first series .
" i have realised that dance is about co-ordination and energy between two people , whether female or male , " tov said .
" the challenge to dance with a woman in a public contest interested me because it 's unique and has never been done before .
" because i share my life with a woman and have a family with her , to me this is the most natural thing to do . "
the show known as rokdim im kokhavim in israel will also feature a guest appearance by pamela anderson.
the former baywatch actress , who took part in the us version of dancing with the stars , will make two appearances in the israeli show , where she will comment on the dances and perform her own routine .
twelve celebrities , including israel 's boxing champion merhav mohar and singer sharon haziz , will compete in the competition until the end of january 2011 when the winner will be selected by public vote .
south african porn film delivers " safe sex " message
the pornography industry in los angeles is on edge after an actor tested positive for hiv .
although the incident led to renewed calls for the use of condoms in porn films , this remains a rarity .
but as ian brimacombe reports , one adult film producer in south africa has decided to make his actors wear condoms to promote safe sex .
" if there are gentle , subtle social messages that wearing a condom is acceptable - that it is normal - then i think , over time , we can all overcome the hurdle of unprotected sex . "
in south africa , views like these have been expressed many times .
it is not every day , though that they are said by a professional pornographer .
and yet , these are the words of tau morena , producer of south africa 's first all-black pornographic film , mapona , which , he says , will promote safe sex and raise awareness about the dangers of hiv aids .
subtlety and pornography tend not to go hand in hand , but mr morena says putting a condom in a scene will benefit the black african consumers who will watch his films .
" i do n't think any amount of advertising will force anyone to wear a condom , " he says .
" but we definitely have a responsibility to encourage people . "
sequel
the south african adult film industry is tiny compared to those of europe and america .
between just three and five titles are produced in south africa a year , and until now , most of the productions have involved white south africans .
the cast of mapona is made up of amateurs who responded to auditions advertised on an amateur porn-site .
all the actors selected were tested for hiv before filming , and the two men involved wear condoms in all the scenes .
south africa has strict censorship laws , but mr morena says his film will be sold in adult film stores across the country .
he says the message of safe sex will be taken a step further , with a second volume of the film , currently under production .
" in africa , information about sex is not readily available , and somehow distorted , " he says .
" there is all sorts of misinformation regarding condoms and their use . "
the dvd package of the sequel will involve audio-visual educational " extras " about sex , like how to correctly put on a condom .
in the united states , federal law requires that all porn actors are tested for hiv 30 days before the start of filming .
the issue of safe sex in adult films was highlighted last week , when a los angeles-based performer tested hiv-positive .
that scare resulted in widespread concern across california 's multi-billion dollar pornography industry , with productions halting filming , and doctors scrambling to track down those people who had performed with the unnamed infected actor .
the clinic at the centre of the scare had a similar incident six years ago when 14 actors were found to be carrying the aids virus .
no testing agency
mr morena says the episode in the us only underlines how important it is for adult film-makers to take safe sex seriously in south africa , where aids kills nearly 1,000 people a day .
" if you look at what they have in america , " says mr morena , " all the actors get tested regularly " .
compare that to our country , where we do n't have a testing agency .
we actually do n't even have real porn stars , we just have amateurs who do n't mind being filmed .
so it 's very important from our side that we go out and test our actors and actresses before we shoot .
the experts have mixed feelings about mr morena 's films .
director of the hiv prevention research unit of the south african medical research council dr gita ramjee says people across the adult film industry should be practicing safer sex , and that message should be written clearly in the title sequences at the start of any adult film .
but while she welcomes the move to safer sex in porn , she is confounded by the messenger .
" i 've never heard of a pornographic film being used for educational purposes , " she says .
" we have a government educational programme at all public health clinics that teach people how to use condoms , " she says , " so i do n't see how this film would add value to the education already provided . "
mr morena , though , says he will do what he can until the average african man understands that wearing a condom during sex can be both good for them and pleasurable .
u.s. protests expulsions of diplomats from ecuador
washington ( cnn ) -- the state department called the expulsion of the second u.s. diplomat from ecuador in just over a week " unjustified , " rejecting charges the diplomats meddled in ecuador 's internal affairs .
first secretary mark sullivan has been given 48 hours to leave the u.s. embassy in quito , ecuador .
on wednesday , the ecuadorian government expelled first secretary mark sullivan , whom it accused of meddling in the government 's internal police policies , giving him 48 hours to leave the country .
on february 7 , the government expelled armando astorga , an attaché with the department of homeland security working in the u.s. embassy .
acting deputy spokesman gordon duguid said the expulsions stem from the fact that certain ecuadorian police were banned from taking part in u.s. counternarcotics training programs , but rejected " any suggestion of wrongdoing by embassy staff . "
" despite the government of ecuador 's unjustified actions , we remain committed to working collaboratively with ecuador to confront narcotics trafficking , " duguid said .
asked whether the state department would reciprocate the expulsions by kicking out ecuadorian diplomats from the united states , duguid would say only , " we will respond as appropriate . "
a senior state department official suggested the ecuador police did not meet the criteria to take part in the training , noting , " the united states does have procedures that require it to vet candidates for u.s.-funded training . "
clinton urges north korean dialogue
hillary clinton has warned north korea relations with the us will not improve until it engages in dialogue with south korea and ends its nuclear ambitions .
the us secretary of state was speaking in the south korean capital , seoul , during her first overseas trip as the top us diplomat .
mrs clinton also announced that stephen bosworth , a former ambassador , would be her new special envoy on north korea .
reports suggest the north korea may be about to test-fire a long-range missile .
mrs clinton said pyongyang should follow through on its commitment to get rid of its nuclear programme , adding that it was important to get six-party talks on the issue back on track .
mr bosworth , who was us ambassador to south korea from 1997 to 2000 , will act as the american envoy to the six-party talks , which also involve japan , china and russia .
'different relationship "
south korea 's prosperity and democracy stood in stark contrast to " the tyranny and poverty across the border to the north " , mrs clinton said .
" north korea is not going to get a different relationship with the united states while insulting and refusing dialogue with the republic of korea , " she said .
her visit to the region comes amid speculation over the health of north korean leader kim-jong-il , after reports he had a stroke last year .
mr kim is not known to have named his successor and western diplomats fear any leadership crisis could further raise tensions on the peninsula .
referring to speculation pyongyang was preparing to test-fire a long-range missile , mrs clinton said the us viewed any such tests as provocative .
" we do n't comment on intelligence matters but it is clear that under the united nations security council resolution 1718 , north korea is required to suspend all activities related to its ballistic programme .
" the north should refrain from violating this resolution and also from any and all provocative actions that could harm the six-party talks and aggravate tensions in the region . "
bbc state department correspondent kim ghattas in seoul says mrs clinton 's words were a stern warning to pyongyang , making clear that while the new administration may be ready to explore new strategies , there will be no softening of tone .
she also praised south korea for what she described as its calm resolve in the face of provocations from the north , our correspondent adds .
hours before mrs clinton arrived in seoul , north korea issued the latest in a series of warnings to its southern neighbour , stating that its troops were " fully ready " for war .
the north 's sabre-rattling over the past few weeks is seen as an attempt to grab the attention of the obama administration and improve its bargaining position when the talks eventually resume , our correspondent says .
mrs clinton arrived in seoul from indonesia - the world 's most populous muslim country - where she said the us was seeking a new kind of dialogue with the muslim world .
cheered in canada , obama treads lightly
ottawa – president barack obama courted warmer relations with america 's snowy northern neighbor thursday , declining to ask war-weary canada to do more in afghanistan , promising he wo n't allow a protectionist creep into u.s. trade policy and talking reassuringly around thorny energy issues .
obama happy crowds cheered his seven-hour visit , his first outside u.s. borders as president .
he returned the compliment with a quick stop at an indoor market where he delighted shopkeepers by picking up pastries and souvenirs for his daughters .
" i love this country and think that we could not have a better friend and ally , " obama said as he appeared side-by-side with canadian prime minister stephen harper at gothic parliament hill .
he later slipped slightly as he walked to his plane and joked that the weather reminded him of chicago .
harper in turn rolled out the red carpet for the new u.s. president .
the conservative leader had been close to president george w. bush , personally and on policy .
but he made clear with subtle jabs backward that he his and his country was casting lot now with the vastly more popular obama .
as we all know , one of president obama 's big missions is to continue world leadership by the united states , but in a way that is more collaborative , " harper said , an apparent reference to bush 's go-it-alone diplomatic style .
still , rhetorical niceties aside , there are some sharp differences between the u.s. and its largest trading partner and biggest supplier of oil .
on several topics , where obama came armed with reassurances , harper offered mini-lectures , albeit gently delivered .
on the 7-year-old afghanistan war , for instance , the canadian leader said that nato and u.s. forces fighting a resurgent taliban insurgency are not " t hrough our own efforts going to establish peace and security in afghanistan . "
with obama 's administration undertaking a broad review of the u.s. strategy there , harper suggested that any new policy " have the idea of an end date , of a transition to afghan responsibility for security , and to greater western partnership for economic development . "
on canada 's massive oil-rich tar sands , harper suggested that the kind of emissions regulations that environmentalists would like obama to support would be unfair , making a comparison to the u.s. coal industry .
" it 's very hard to have a tough regulatory system here when we are competing with an unregulated economy south of the border , " harper said .
on trade , obama stuck to his pledge to eventually seek changes in the 1994 north american free trade agreement to increase enforcement of labor and environmental standards — but said he intended to do so in a way "that is not disruptive to the extraordinarily important trade relationships that exist between the united states and canada . "
harper said he might be willing to negotiate , but not by " opening the whole nafta and unraveling what is a very complex agreement . "
he sounded a similar warning on a " buy american " clause that congress added to the $ 787 billion economic stimulus package .
the provision 's passage fits into a larger fear among free-trading canadians that america is cultivating a protectionist streak as its economy tanks and hemorrhages jobs .
obama repeatedly took a non-confrontational approach .
on trade , he declared that he had told harper : " i want to grow trade and not contract it . "
on afghanistan , obama said unprompted that he had not asked the prime minister for any more canadian commitments .
just a handful of nations , including canada , are doing the heavy lifting there by fighting in the country 's dangerous southern and eastern provinces .
canada , which has lost more than 100 people in afghanistan , is withdrawing its 2,500 combat forces out of the volatile south by 2011 .
" we just wanted to make sure that we were saying thank you , " obama said .
the president announced earlier this week that he is sending 17,000 more u.s. troops to afghanistan to augment the 33,000 already there .
it was just over half the increase that u.s. commanders have requested , and obama left the door open to additional increases once the strategy review is finished in late march .
on the oil sands issue , obama probably scored points with his hosts by linking the environmental problems of the canadian industry with those in the u.s. coal industry .
industry officials estimate the northern alberta sands could yield as much as 175 billion barrels of oil , making canada second only to saudi arabia in crude oil reserves .
but the extraction process produces a high amount of the greenhouse gases blamed for climate change .
environmental groups want obama to resist harper 's efforts to exempt them from regulation .
obama instead focused on the idea of developing carbon capture and storage to help turn the sands into a clean source of power , a largely unproven and not yet cost-effective technology that would bury harmful emissions underground .
the topic was the only one to produce an announcement , though a minor one .
the leaders said they had decided to begin a new clean-energy dialogue to advance carbon-reduction technologies and the development of a modern electric grid .
presidents send signals with their choices of their maiden international trips , and by coming here obama meant to show that energy and afghanistan are at the top of his list .
but with the u.s. economy in free fall , he chose not to make a long visit , not even staying for dinner .
the canadian public did n't seem to care , with many spending hours on buses to come to the snowy capital in hopes of just a glimpse .
the crowd of many hundreds that had started gathering at 4 a.m. in the square outside parliament erupted in a deafening cheer when the u.s. leader waved for a moment from behind a partition before disappearing inside with harper .
along his motorcade route , a woman held up a " yes we canada " sign , a playful reference to obama 's campaign motto .
there was one small obama slip .
during his joint appearance with harper , obama started out by remarking his great pleasure at being in what he clearly started to say was " iowa . "
he quickly corrected himself to say " ottawa . "
the day afforded obama his first experience with many of the pomp-filled ingredients of a presidential journey abroad .
with a light snow falling at the airport , a double line of royal canadian mounted police in their bright red coats stood at attention .
obama was greeted by the representative of britain 's queen elizabeth ii , michaelle jean .
he took obama inside the terminal for a brief discussion .
obama later met in the same room at the end of his visit with liberal opposition leader michael ignatieff .
throughout his visit , american flags fluttered alongside canadian ones .
obama picks nobel man for energy
barack obama has named physics nobel prize winner steven chu as his energy secretary and tasked him with finding alternatives to fossil fuels .
the us president-elect said the new administration 's priorities were to end us dependence on foreign oil and fight climate change .
naming his environment team , he said us energy dependence had grown even as global resources were disapp earing .
mr obama has pledged to make big changes in environmental policies .
after eight years , he said , the us could not accept more broken promises when the new administration took over on 20 january .
despite the current economic crisis , the president-elect has vowed to make the environment a priority with an ambitious promise of creating 2.5m new jobs , says the bbc 's andy gallacher in washington .
boundless opportunities
announcing his environment team at a press conference on monday , mr obama vowed to " move beyond our oil addiction and create a new hybrid economy " .
" all of us know the problems that are rooted in our addiction to foreign oil , " he said .
" it constrains our economy , shifts wealth to hostile regimes and leaves us dependent on unstable regions . "
he said these " urgent dangers " were only eclipsed by the long-term threat of climate change .
" unless we act , climate change will lead to drought and famine abroad , devastating weather patterns and terrible storms on our shores and the disappearance of our coastline , " said mr obama .
he added that there were boundless opportunities to create new jobs in the environmental industry .
trapping atoms
the energy secretary-elect is an energy specialist and the director of the lawrence berkeley national laboratory .
dr chu is a leader in the field of combating climate change using scientific methods .
he shared the 1997 nobel prize for physics for his work on cooling and trapping atoms using laser light .
announcing his environment team nominations , mr obama named lisa jackson , currently the chief of staff for new jersey 's governor , as head of the environment protection agency ( epa ) .
ms jackson , who also worked for the epa under mr clinton in the 1990s , would be the agency 's first african-american administrator .
mr obama said carol browner , the former head of the epa under bill clinton , would co-ordinate white house policy on energy and climate change .
he also named nancy sutley , a deputy mayor of los angeles , as head of the white house council on environmental quality .
obituary : robert mcnamara
former american secretaries of defence seldom get such widespread obituaries as robert s mcnamara .
despite a distinguished career which saw him at the centre of power or influence at some of the most troubled times of the 20th century , it was errol morris 's 2003 film , the fog of war , subtitled eleven lessons from the life of robert mcnamara , which singled out this former defence secretary .
in the film , mcnamara spoke frankly about the vietnam war , the cuban missile crisis and world war ii , giving a behind-the-scenes account of the context in which important decisions were taken , in so doing raising questions about the nature of war and human behaviour .
cuban missile crisis
a brilliant statistician , he was drafted to help develop methods of statistical control for managing the strategic bombing campaigns against germany and japan .
he worked with general curtis lemay on the firebombing of 67 japanese cities that killed almost a million people , 100,000 on one night in wooden tokyo .
in the fog of war , he agreed with lemay 's assertion that the pair " were behaving as war criminals " and would have been tried as such had their side lost .
in 1946 , mcnamara was hired by the ford motor company to rejuvenate its flagging sales .
he rose to become the first president of the company outside the ford family .
he was one of the first to introduce safety features in order to reduce the death rate in crashes .
but in 1960 , he was snapped up by president john f kennedy to become his defence secretary .
in this post , he reformed pentagon practices , oversaw a huge military build-up and was centrally involved in the cuban missile crisis of 1962 , when soviet nuclear missiles were discovered in cuba and the world teetered on the brink of a nuclear war for 13 days .
hate figure
in the film , he described gen lemay , at that time an adviser to kennedy , and fidel castro , as the two most dangerous personalities of that crisis .
gen lemay wanted to attack cuba unilaterally , while mr castro told him that he had pressed soviet leader nikita krushchev to attack the united states with nuclear weapons if the us invaded .
during the vietnam war , mcnamara supported us efforts to prevent the victory of communist insurgents over the government of south vietnam .
to anti-war protesters at the time , mcnamara became something of a hate figure , an arrogant ultra-hawk responsible for escalating the war .
yet recently-released tapes of conversations between mcnamara and president lyndon johnson , used in the fog of war , reveal johnson chiding his defence secretary for having advised kennedy to pull american military advisers out of vietnam .
instead , johnson put ground troops into vietnam following the gulf of tonkin incident in which , it was claimed , vietnamese torpedo boats had attacked us warships .
mcnamara confirmed that these attacks never actually took place .
haunted by vietnam
by 1966 , mcnamara had begun to question the wisdom of us involvement in vietnam and , a year later , was privately advising johnson to end the war by negotiation .
he initiated a full investigation of the american commitment to vietnam .
but johnson escalated the war further by bombing north vietnam .
mcnamara left the job in 1968 .
the war eventually claimed the lives of three million vietnamese and 58,000 americans .
almost immediately , he took up the presidency of the world bank where he remained until 1981 , focusing on the developing world .
in later years , he became a prolific author and lecturer .
his role in the vietnam war continued to haunt him , though .
it was his memoir , in retrospect : the tragedy and lessons of vietnam ( 1995 ) , which inspired the fog of war movie .
he described the war as " terribly wrong " owing to a combination of the anti-communist climate of the times , mistaken assumptions of foreign policy and military mis judgements .
critics claimed his admission came 30 years too late .
in 2004 , at the age of 88 , he married 70-year-old diana byfield .
it was his second marriage - his first wife margaret , to whom he was married for 40 years , died of cancer in 1981 .
robert mcnamara once said , " i do n't believe we should apply our power unilaterally .
if we ca n't persuade nations with similar values , we 'd better re-examine our reasoning . "
u.s. accession to amity treaty aims at regaining interests in southeast asia
08:22 , july 24 , 2009
agreement to the treaty of amity and cooperation by the united states indicates america has re-engaged with southeast asia and will regain interests in the region , a chinese analyst said thursday .
meanwhile , due to mutual demands between the united states and southeast asian countries , the move also will strengthen bilateral cooperation in the fields of economy , trade and climate change , said guo xiangang , a scholar from the china institute of international studies .
a u.s. presence in southeast asia would complicate and bring uncertainties to regional issues , guo said .
strategic deployment
u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton signed the friendship pact with member states of the association of southeast asia nations ( asean ) in thailand 's phuket on wednesday in what is seen as america 's return to the " critically important " region .
clinton said the obama administration wanted to send a strong message of engagement after the region had been neglected by former president george w. bush during the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
the new u.s. approach was demonstrated by her first overseas trip as the top u.s. diplomat to asia in february , clinton said , adding that washington views the amity treaty as a symbolic underscoring of american commitment to asia .
guo said that the u.s. return to southeast asia is part of a multilateral diplomatic policy proposed by the obama administration , which is considered a revision of bush 's unilateral policy .
the united states wants to participate in the region 's development process to show its clout in the area and to help solve problems such as the korean peninsula nuclear issue and myanmar 's ongoing political instability , the researcher said .
" if the united states does not take part in the process , it can not effectively impose its influence in the region , " he said .
mutual demands
on the one side , the signing of the treaty means the americans would regain interests in southeast asia , the sixth largest u.s. export market and an important strategic stronghold with abundant oil and energy resources .
on the other side , southeast asian countries welcomed the u.s. participation in the region 's development process , during which they would get the biggest possible interests as they can , guo said .
" southeast asian countries tried to use big powers and strategic balance to seek their own security and stability , " the analyst said .
the cooperation between the united states and the four mekong downriver countries -- cambodia , laos , thailand and vietnam -- shows that the americans attach importance to the region , said yue yang , a vietnamese researcher .
asean leaders have also hailed u.s. accession to the amity treaty .
" we warmly welcomed the impending accession by the united states of america to the treaty of amity and cooperation in southeast asia as a strong signal of its commitment to peace and security in the region , " said a joint communique issued monday after the asean ministers 's meeting .
potential complication
the row between the united states and myanmar over the case of aung san suu kyi , who was facing trial for violating her terms of house arrest by accommodating a u.s. citizen , has been spotlighted since may .
myanmar 's government leaders have frequently said that the legal action against aung san suu kyi is an internal affair which is in accordance with its domestic law , accusing the united states of meddling in its internal affairs .
clinton called on myanmar , which has put suu kyi , general secretary of the national league for democracy , under a five-and-a-half-year house arrest , to free her and take other steps to ensure a credible general election next year .
the myanmar authorities have blamed the u.s. citizen , identified as john william yettaw , for the current trial involving aung san suu kyi .
meeting with the press , myanmar police chief brigadier-general khin yi charged yettaw with illegally intruding into aung san suu kyi 's residence which was then under restriction and held him mainly accountable for the case .
analysts said the u.s.-myanmar spat brought uncertainty and complication to the region 's development .
clinton views asean as a region of " great diversity where people of different backgrounds , religions and every other diversities of the human experience are working to build a community . "
moreover , clinton talked about the nuclear issues of the democratic people 's republic of korea and iran at the asean foreign ministers 's meeting , a sign indicating that the u.s. return to southeast asia is broader than expected , analysts said .
china 's gains in manufacturing stir friction across the pacific
china is on its way to surpassing the u.s. as the world 's largest manufacturer far sooner than expected .
the question is , does that matter ?
in terms of actual size , the answer is , no .
but if size is a proxy for relative health of each nation 's sector , the answer is yes .
anyone who walks the aisles of a u.s. retailer might think china already is the world 's largest manufacturer .
but , in fact , the u.s. retains that distinction by a wide margin .
in 2007 , the latest year for which data are available , the u.s. accounted for 20 % of global manufacturing ; china was 12 % .
the gap , though , is closing rapidly .
according to ihs global insight , an economic-forecasting firm in lexington , mass. , china will produce more in terms of real value-added by 2015 .
using value-added as a measure avoids the problem of double-counting by tallying the value created at each step of an extended production process .
as recently as two years ago , global insight 's estimate was that china would surpass the u.s. as the world 's top manufacturer by 2020 .
last year , it pulled the date forward to 2016 or 2017 .
" the recent deep recession in u.s. manufacturing does mean that china 's catch-up is occurring a few years earlier than would have been the case if there had been no recession , " says nariman behravesh , the group 's chief economist .
u.s. manufacturing is shrinking , shedding jobs and , in the wake of this deep recession , producing and exporting far fewer goods , while china 's factories keep expanding .
if manufacturers on both sides of the pacific were thriving , there would be little reason to butt heads .
but given the massive trade gap between the two nations and uncertainty in the u.s. over when and to what degree manufacturing will recover , china 's ascent has become a point of growing friction .
chinese manufacturing activity continued to tick up in july from the previous month , data from the china federation of logistics and purchasing showed saturday .
the purchasing managers index edged up to 53.3 in july , from 53.2 in june and 53.1 in may .
a separate clsa china purchasing managers index rose to a 12-month high of 52.8 in july from 51.8 in june , clsa asia-pacific markets said monday .
july was the fourth consecutive month the clsa pmi was above 50 after hovering below the key level for eight months .
many economists argue that the shrinking of u.s. manufacturing -- both in terms of jobs and share of gross domestic product -- is a normal economic evolution that started long before china emerged as a manufacturing powerhouse .
from their point of view , the shrinking would happen regardless and is actually a sign of health that the sector does n't need to be big to be productive and is shedding low-skill jobs and creating select higher-skill ones .
global insight 's mr. behravesh is one of those who views china 's rise as normal , even healthy .
" in the natural course , countries go from agriculture to manufacturing to services , " he says .
" to subsidize manufacturing pushes the u.s. down that curve . "
but another school of thought -- one known by the somewhat backhanded label of " manufacturing fundamentalists " -- contends the u.s. decline is n't natural and must be reversed to retain america 's economic power .
from their perspective , that necessitates fighting chinese policies that fuel low-cost exports , swamping a variety of industries from textiles to tires .
" the notion that we can be a nonmanufacturing society is folly , " says peter morici , an economist at the university of maryland .
" it 's pseudo-science that gives rise to the collapse of civilizations . "
the obama administration is stepping carefully through this minefield .
at a two-day conference last week , the first meeting of a new forum designed to foster closer cooperation between the two countries , china 's tightly managed currency policy was barely discussed even though it is a hot-button issue for many u.s.-based producers and organized labor .
they argue that china undervalues its currency to gain a competitive advantage for its exports , which sell at a lower price in the u.s.
the u.s. business and industry council , which represents u.s.-based manufacturers , accused the obama administration of " panda-hugging . "
the administration earlier this year softened its stance on the issue when it declined to label china a currency manipulator .
john engler , president of the national association of manufacturers , says he does n't expect china to surpass the u.s. before 2020 .
" it may or may not continue to grow so rapidly , " he says .
" the importance of the china challenge to the u.s. depends on how we respond to it , " such as implementing tax and investment policies that encourage domestic producers to expand .
mr. engler 's group faces a delicate issue of its own regarding china : many of its powerful members produce in china and are eager to avoid controversy on trade issues , while the group 's large roster of smaller members are often outspoken critics of china .
even in its weakened state , manufacturing remains a surprisingly large part of the u.s. economy .
the sector generates more than 13% of the nation 's gdp , making it a bigger contributor to the economy than retail trade , finance or the health-care industry .
in china , manufacturing represents 34% of gdp .
still , the concern remains that u.s. manufacturers now being hit by the economic downturn will never recover .
j.b. brown , president of bremen castings inc. , a family-owned foundry in bremen , ind. , says the downturn has halted what had been a hopeful trend that emerged last year of work returning to the u.s. from china .
" i see a lot of people starting to look at going overseas again ," he says , in part because costs are rising in the u.s. even in the depth of this recession .
he notes , for instance , that bremen 's electricity rates jumped 17% this year -- and the company has been warned they could increase even more next year .
foundries like bremen use large amounts of electricity to heat metal .
china , vietnam hold talks on south china sea issue

chinese agency says " hidden trouble " in south china sea becomes prominent
text of report by hong kong-based news agency zhongguo tongxun she
beijing , 13 july ( zts ) - the south china sea issue has a long history .
the chinese government has long been engaged in resolving the issue in a peaceful manner and has tried hard to create peaceful and stable surroundings .
the current overall situation in the south china sea is comparatively stable .
however , hidden problems have become prominent .
the most recent issue of " world vision " cited the president of hainan research institute for the south china sea ( hriscs ) , saying that abundant natural resources in the south china sea and the important strategic position of this sea as a maritime passage have made the south china sea a point for heated competition for all prospective parties .
the south china sea dispute involves china and its neighbors in the region ( such as vietnam , the philippines , malaysia and brunei ) .
however , countries beyond this area - such as the united states , japan and india - have also actively engaged in the dispute .
this area remains stable , yet influenced by multiple parties .
neighboring countries in the area follow a very clear strategy on the south china sea issue : complicate the nansha issue so as to force china between a rock and a hard place and make it impossible for china to resolve the issue immediately .
natural resource development has made competition for south china sea prominent .
" the nansha dispute over the sovereignty of islands and the jurisdiction of the sea is , in essence , a collusion of strategic interests and competition for natural resource s , " said president wu shicun .
countries around the south china sea have stepped up their exploration and development of oil and natural gas , have openly invited bidding , and have invited international oil companies to develop .
neighboring countries get at least 50 million tons of petroleum from the south china sea per year , equal to the annual output of the daqing oilfield .
neighboring countries in the region have already divided the south china sea among themselves - an area characterized by overlapping oilfields .
these countries have continuously expanded their scope of exploration , the majority of which lies within china 's traditional border .
international affairs specialist prof. feng yongfu believes that china - as the large power in this area - should hold the dominant position in this area .
china should not sit by and wait for foreign countries to execute plans for the joint development of resources .
instead , china should take the initiative to propose and execute a plan to demonstrate the presence of china in the nanhai dispute , in the course of natural resource development in the south china sea .
attitudes of large powers deserve our attention .
currently , all countries in the southeast but indonesia - such as the philippines , malaysia and vietnam - have set up special agencies to defend their marine rights and have even used military force to control neighboring sea areas .
at the end of last year , the indonesian government set up a special bureau of arrests within the ministry of maritime and fisheries affairs .
this bureau was equipped with nearly 30 supervisory ships and with one rear admiral coordinating all sectors during operations .
vessels of this bureau have broken into china 's traditional maritime territories many times to seize and suspend chinese fishing boats .
according to the international herald tribune , these countries arrested chinese fisherman who were fishing there legally and released them ; this has occurred repeatedly .
this has actually demonstrated their control and jurisdiction over this maritime area ; and represents a kind of sovereignty oath to their belief .
the attitude of large international powers such as the united states and australia - deserves our great attention .
according to the kuala lumpur security review , the chief of the defense force , air chief marshal angus houston , told the magazine that australia 's interest in the south china sea lies in maintaining wider stability in this region , including the disputed nansha islands , so that this sea passage - which is also one of important global maritime passages - can continue to be open and in free use .
us defense secretary robert gates recently said that the us position in the dispute over the sovereignty of the nansha islands is : " the united states does not have any position . "
however , the united states sent four aegis-equipped warships to conduct a joint military practice session with southeast asian countries in the south china sea , which has rarely happened before .
according to this magazine , the malaysian stage of this practice session began in the last 10 days of june .
during this stage , the united states sent 1,600 officers and soldiers , two aegis-equipped warships - " xiafei " ( pinyin ) and " zhongyun " ( pinyin ) - p3c anti-submarine patrol airplanes as well as fa-18 hornet airplanes to the practice session .
on 28 june , warships from the united states and malaysia gathered in the south china sea and conducted a fleet formation drill .
us warship specialists said that the significance of the presence of us aegis-equipped warships in the south china sea is that once a war breaks out , the us warships may create an anti-air shield in the south china sea .

why chimerica remains a chimera
william choong , senior writer
in the early 1990s , when washington debated the alternatives of engaging or containing china , some clever wits suggested a hybrid : 'congagement " .
later , former president george w. bush proposed that china was a 'strategic competitor " .
now , no one disputes the notion that china and the united states are strategic partners .
the recently concluded strategic and economic dialogue between washington and beijing will be cheered by asians .
the dialogue - which has progressed from being a purely economic dialogue to one that covers strategic issues as well - indicates the two countries are now committed to a formal mechanism to work on a broad spectrum of issues .
in all , government-to-government linkages between the two countries involve 60 bilateral dialogues .
the us and china also see eye to eye on diverse issues such as counter-terrorism , the management of north korea 's nuclear programme and anti-piracy deployments in the gulf of aden .
no wonder , some commentators have begun to speculate of the us and china constituting a g-2 - or " chimerica " as economic historian niall ferguson calls the condominium .
dr zbigniew brzezinski , a former us national security adviser , argues that a g-2 could help address a number of challenges , from the global financial crisis to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
such arguments are not entirely convincing .
lord palmerston 's rubric - countries have no permanent friends , only permanent interests - still rings true .
currently , the crux of the sino-american relations is not really strategic but economic : the us is the world 's biggest debtor , while china is america 's biggest lender .
former diplomat christopher clarke has suggested that the sino-us financial symbiosis is more like a " mutual death grip in which neither side dares make a precipitous move for fear of going over the cliff with the other " .
washington - which has traditionally been a strident critic of china 's human rights record - has toned down its rhetoric in recent years .
asked whether she intended to raise human rights issues during her first visit to beijing earlier this year , secretary of state hillary clinton indicated that the us had bigger issues to tackle , such as the global financial crisis and climate change .
this is understandable .
the us , being a mendicant borrower , cannot be talking back harshly to its bankers in beijing .
if a us-china condominium were to emerge , it would ring alarm bells across the region , particularly in long-term allies of washington such as japan , australia and south korea .
in the past decade , it has been fashionable to suggest that china might seek to undermine america 's alliance relationships in asia .
but as mr dennis wilder , formerly the senior director for east asian affairs at the us national security council , has pointed out , the opposite is more likely .
he writes : ' a more realistic chinese goal may be to create a partnership with the us in which our asian allies , such as japan , south korea , australia , thailand and the philippines , are relegated to a subordinate status and the us and china would share asian pre-eminence - at least for a time . '
the first country to suffer from this would be japan , which for decades has banked on its relationship with the us to pre-empt any external threat .
if a g-2 were to emerge , japan may even break its vow never to possess nuclear weapons .
a g-2 condominium will also worry the asian countries that have staked claims to disputed territories in the south china sea .
china recently criticised claims made by malaysia and vietnam on disputed seabed and subsoil resources in that vital body of water .
no one can quite imagine what would ensue if the security situation in the south china sea were to deteriorate and the us were to look away as china contemplates the use of force against rival disputants .
on the bright side , it is unlikely that the g-2 will emerge anytime soon .
for one , the security dilemma between the us and china still runs deep , with each of them questioning the motivation behind the other 's military posture in the asia-pacific .
writing in foreign affairs in june , ms elizabeth economy and dr adam segal of the council for foreign relations argued that the gulf in interests , values and capabilities between the two countries would prevent them from moving towards a great power condominium .
speaking to the straits times recently , admiral timothy keating , the commander of the us pacific command , seemed to concur .
while saying he was encouraged by the candour of recent sino-american diplomatic interactions , he rubbished the idea of a g-2 .
" the notion that a g-2 is developing ... is not correct , " he said .
'we are much more interested in multilateral and collaborative efforts , involving all our friends and allies in the asia-pacific region , and not only us-china relations . "
this might sound reassuring for many countries in asia .
their view of us-sino relations will long adhere to the goldilocks principle : not too cold , not too hot , but just nice .
china 's war for ore
business is being reshaped around the world .
china was miffed by the outcome of what we last year called the corporate " deal of the century . "
but shareholder interests preva iled .
how often will that be said in the future ?
politics , that ugly dynamic when mixed with business , was already back in play last week as rio tinto , an australian mining giant at the heart of the controversy , saw four of its chinese executives arrested in shanghai on spying charges .
china says the busts are not retribution for the cancelled deal between rio and a state-owned company , which received angry press in china .
instead , the arrests supposedly arise from skullduggery by rio officials during fraught annual ore-price negotiations with mainland steelmakers .
but the distinction may be irrelevant .
ore has become a major neuralgic concern for china .
it sees its dependence on imported supply as strategically risky .
it fears that its massive attempts to " stimulate " domestic job growth are being drained off as fatter profits for australian mining companies .
when the intrigue is unraveled , moreover , do n't be surprised if the arrests are partly aimed at corralling the mainland 's own restive steelmakers , many of whom have not cooperated in beijing 's ore strategy but have been striking their own spot market deals at higher prices .
but let 's step back .
rio has been wrongfooted over and over lately amid the zigzagging of the world 's monetary conditions , whose chaos is now disastrously reshaping business- government relations globally ( think the obama administration 's ownership of most of the detroit auto industry ) .
when china was booming , rio played coy in the face of a merger bid from fellow miner bhp billiton 18 months ago , acknowledging the " industrial logic " of the deal but insisting the offering price was " several ballparks " short of fair value .
oops .
with the collapse of lehman and the global meltdown , ore prices plummeted and bhp withdrew its bid .
suddenly , rio needed its own debt bailout and turned to a company on the cash-rich mainland , state-owned chinalco .
beijing was doubly pleased by the $ 19.5 billion chinalco deal .
not only was china getting ownership of australian ore assets at a bargain price , but the deal also killed off any chance of a bhp merger , seen on the mainland as an aussie plot to gouge china .
oops .
the chinalco proposal ran into a buzzsaw of nationalist opposition in australia .
and while a government review board dragged its feet , the delay allowed ben bernanke to rev up the monetary engine and china to launch its own massive stimulus .
ore prices recovered .
a bhp joint venture was back on the table .
in a jilting worthy of a judy blume novel , rio last month dumped its chinese savior and leapt into bed with its erstwhile australian suitor .
now the chinese naturally see dirty politics at work , but the deal was actually scuttled by rio 's shareholders , who rightly saw more upside in bhp 's offer .
yet it 's also true the chinalco bid would likely eventually have been torpedoed by the australian government .
polls were running strongly against selling the country 's mineral patrimony to a company ultimately controlled by the chinese communist party .
australia prime minister kevin rudd , who prides himself on being an old china hand , must have been overjoyed when this icky chalice was taken from his lips by rio 's shareholders
yet the politics have only turned ickier since the rio arrests .
and beijing has other cards up its sleeve .
it can take its opposition to the bhp-rio deal to europe 's trustbusters , who voiced qualms about their earlier proposed tie-up .
china also can make use of its own new anti-monopoly law , which has already been used to punish the u.s. for blocking an oil deal .
earlier this year , chinese regulators nixed coca-cola 's purchase of a local juicemaker on " competition " grounds that antitrust lawyers considered ludicrous .
more disturbing , china has upped its ore purchases in recent weeks even as mainland growth seems to be slowing , suggesting an effort to lay in a stockpile for a longer showdown against rio-bhp .
if the rio arrests mark the beginning of a chinese war to remake the global ore market more to china 's liking , beijing might want to think again .
its clumsy attempt to make computer makers instruments of internet censorship was not exactly confidence-inspiring .
ensuring nobody wants to do a business deal with china for fear of being charged with a death penalty crime hardly improves the case .
then there 's the epic civil disorder in xinjiang .
the final casualty may be china 's overblown reputation for macroeconomic competence , on which so many hopes for global recovery depend .
there are already signs its stimulus efforts are running off the rails .
the world might appreciate a signal right now that china 's government actually knows what it 's doing .
does beijing really want to " break up " india ?
ananth krishnan
what the overreaction in india to an anonymous post on an obscure chinese website calling for " splitting india " reveals about the challenges of understanding china 's changing information landscape .
whoever the anonymous internet user " zhong guo zhuan le gang " ( literally , " chinese strategist " ) is , he must be quite pleased with himself .
little more than a week ago , a post by him appeared on an obscure chinese website calling for china to " break up " the " hindu religious state " of india for its own strategic gains .
the post was translated and analysed , with some significant errors , by a chennai-based think-tank , following which reports appeared in the indian media expressing outrage that " beijing " had a secret plan to divide india by supporting separatist movements in kashmir and the northeast .
leave aside for a moment the contents of the post , which to most readers with even a little understanding of foreign policy reveals an inexperienced writer with poor understanding of india , far removed from a supposedly influential chinese strategist .
also leave aside the question of whether having broken-up states on its borders with the troubled xinjiang region and in north-east india even really suits chinese interests .
the real question to be asked here is why and how does an anonymous post by an insignificant chinese blogger generate such attention and consternation in india ?
part of the answer lies in the media reports that appeared last week , which made the following assumptions :
an influential chinese strategist must have been behind the suggestions ;
he must have had the tacit backing of beijing since all opinion in china is controlled by the government ;
and that the website where this post appeared sounded influential enough for india to take notice and worry .
but in these assumptions are fundamental misperceptions .
for one , there is a tendency to assume every view expressed by a chinese strategist or newspaper – let alone an anonymous blogger - is inextricably linked to beijing and the chinese government 's views .
this tendency is located in the prevalence of the idea of a monolith china and " chinese " view which dominates indian perceptions .
this was especially evident last week , when news reports in national newspapers , without exception , linked the claims made by the anonymous blogger to " what beijing thinks " .
this perception dates back to the 1970s and 1980s , when the only opinions coming out of china were voiced through one or two state-run organs , and often closely mirrored the chinese government 's views .
the last decade has seen the emergence of a completely different information landscape in china .
yet the manner in which this information is processed and interpreted in india remains rooted in the past .
the nineties saw the emergence of dozens of new newspapers in china , a few dozen think-tanks in beijing and a proliferation of voices expressed through the internet .
currently , there are four main avenues through which information emerges out of china .
their status and roles need spelling out , as understanding and evaluating the nature of this information is crucial for india to create a level of discourse that allows for a more layered analysis of china 's opportunities and threats .
most significant is the official channel through china 's foreign ministry , which voices china 's official position on issues .
the second , more complicated channel is print media .
there are dozens of newspapers in beijing , and most are state-owned .
but each enjoys a unique relationship with both the government and the communist party ( cpc ) , and consequently , their opinions need to be interpreted contextually .
for instance , the people 's daily , the cpc 's mouthpiece , often articulates the party 's stand , which does not necessarily reflect the chinese government 's official position .
recently , the paper ran a strong editorial aimed at india , crudely belittling india 's political status and calling for a stronger chinese stand on the border dispute and other issues .
this was interpreted in india as the chinese government changing its position .
while the chinese government on occasion does use the newspaper to articulate its views , the newspaper is more often used by different factions within the cpc in internal debates and has less impact on actual policy .
for instance , some groups within the cpc favour a more hawkish attitude to india , and others in the government a more conciliatory position .
the distinction between party and government is not often clear even in china .
this poses a challenge for indian observers to tease out what opinions really matter to the countries ' relationship , and what opinions are no more than postures adopted for the sake of internal party politics and are less relevant to the countries ' ties .
the third category , also diverse , is think-tanks .
in the last decade , dozens of think-tanks — many with similar sounding names , to add to the confusion — have emerged in china .
the fourth and newest avenue of information is the internet , through chinese blogs and websites .
confusion between the last two categories was at the heart of last week 's uproar .
the post in question appeared on an important-sounding website calling itself the international institute of strategic studies ( which has no relation to the london-based think-tank of the same name ) .
the chennai centre for china stu dies , which first translated and analysed the post before it was circulated among the indian media , assumed that this was a government-sponsored think-tank , and also wrongly claimed that this was linked to the china institute for international strategic studies ( ciiss ) , a beijing think-tank .
but a quick check revealed that the iiss website where the post appeared actually has no government ties , and is by no means an established beijing think-tank - it 's just a website .
scholars at the ciiss and other institutes said they had n't even heard of it , and expressed amusement at the media circus that the obscure website had caused in india .
the website 's founder kang lingyi issued a clarification saying his website was independent and had no link to the government .
what news reports did not mention was mr. kang , who is only in his twenties , represents a fringe firebrand nationalistic viewpoint that has in the past tried to stir public opinion against another neighbour of china 's — japan .
mr. kang 's views often reflect those of a section known in china as the " fenqing " — it literally translates to " angry youth " , but when pronounced slightly differently describes such youth in a far less kind way , one that 's not fit to print .
this reflects the position these views hold in the mainstream in china — and the error in assuming these fringe views mirror beijing 's position .
but even the nationalistic mr. kang distanced himself from the post and stressed that in no way did his website approve of its message .
news reports also claimed the write-up could not have been published without the permission of the chinese authorities — another dubious claim tied to the simplistic notion that the chinese government vets every opinion expressed on all of china 's hundreds of political websites .
the chinese government blocks and censors numerous websites that are politically sensitive , discussing subjects like the tiananmen square protests or the falun gong .
but suggesting that the government controls and moderates debates and political opinions in blogs and newspapers is a stretch .
it also belies a lack of understanding of the changing nature of china 's information landscape .
china has 338 million internet users and more than 100 million blogs and websites , such as the one where this post first appeared .
it only takes a quick glance through half a dozen such sites - even " influential " ones - to look at the divergence of opinions and vibrancy of debates , with many voices even strongly criticising the communist party and its government .
yet the simplistic perception still endures in india that in authoritarian china , every analyst or writer must surely speak in the same voice .
interpreting information from these four avenues is further complicated by the fact that they are sometimes inter-linked .
for instance , the chinese government sometimes uses influential think-tanks to hint at changes in policy .
views and opinions from mainstream chinese newspapers and think-tanks must indeed be taken seriously in india .
but at the same time , a more nuanced understanding of china 's information landscape is needed to avoid shrill hyper-reactions to anonymous bloggers and irrelevant fringe groups .
this is crucial to creating a level of discourse in india that allows for a deeper , more meaningful engagement with china 's opportunities and threats .
nigeria rebel group to resume attacks , ends talks
source : reuters
* main militant group to end ceasefire on sept. 15
* rebel group vows fresh attacks against oil industry
* hundreds of militants surrender arms in amnesty programme
( updates with mend to resume attacks , new throughout )
by austin ekeinde
yenagoa , nigeria , aug 22 ( reuters ) - nigeria 's main rebel group said on saturday it would resume attacks against africa 's biggest energy industry next month , overshadowing the surrender of hundreds of arms by rebels in a federal amnesty programme .
the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta ( mend ) , responsible for attacks that have wrought havoc on the opec member 's oil operations , said it would resume its campaign of violence on sept. 15 .
mend , a loose coalition of militant groups , denounced the hundreds of rebels that have participated in president umaru yar'adua 's 60-day amnesty programme , which aims to stem unrest in the niger delta .
" the ongoing amnesty programme by the government of nigeria seems to have achieved separating those who still have the zeal to fight for our freedom from those who were in it for the money ," the group said in a statement .
mend , which declared a 60-day ceasefire in july to allow for peace talks , said it has suspended negotiations with the government .
hundreds of nigerian militants earlier on saturday surrendered their weapons , mortar bombs and gunboats during a public ceremony in the bayelsa state capital yenagoa .
the handover by dozens of militant groups was the largest collection of weapons and ammunition since president umaru yar'adua 's 60-day amnesty programme began two weeks ago .
a chance for peace
" we give up our weapons so that we give peace a chance and for all oil companies and other multinationals to come into our region to develop the place , " said erepamutei olotu , known as general ogunbos , during a public handing-over ceremony .
attacks on pipelines and industry facilities along with the kidnapping of oil workers since early 2006 have cost the world 's eighth-biggest oil exporter billions of dollars a year in lost revenues and added to volatility in global energy prices .
at the ceremony , former militant leader ebikabowei victor ben , known as boyloaf , gave a senior government official his flak jacket emblazoned with the logo of nigeria 's most prominent militant group -- the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta ( mend ) .
" as chairman of mend in bayelsa state , i hand over this jacket as a proclamation that we have disarmed and stand by our word .
we expect the president to stand by his word and develop the niger delta . "
ben told a crowd of hundreds that included former militants , government officials and security officers .
ben was among 25 former militant leaders that surrendered more than 500 weapons , dozens of rocket launchers and mortar bombs and 14 gunboats , which were on display at the ceremony .
ben , whose group handed over the bulk of the weapons collected on saturday , has warned that failure to develop the niger delta would lead to a resumption of violence .
sceptics question whether the amnesty scheme will buy anything more than a short-term lull in the violence , saying the government has done little to create employment or training opportunities for those who do hand over their guns .
mend has said a replacement to take over boyloaf 's command had already been put in place , somewhat undermining the point of his departure , and other key commanders in the creeks of the delta have shown no such willingness to take part .
no mention has been made of other hardliners like ateke tom , farah dagogo or government tompolo -- against whom the military launched its biggest campaign for years just months ago -- joining the amnesty programme .
a previous attempt at disarmament under yar'adua 's predecessor olusegun obasanjo in 2004 broke down as factions argued over the money paid for their weapons .
thousands of guns were handed over but the subsequent five years were among the most violent in the history of the niger delta .
five killed as police face syringe protesters in chinese city
beijing , china ( cnn ) -- the latest unrest in western china has left five people dead and 14 hurt , a deputy mayor said friday .
the deaths and injuries were in the city of urumqi , said zhang hong , the city 's deputy mayor .
demonstrators have clashed with police in urumqi for two days amid a strange string of syringe stabbings .
some han chinese demonstrators have taken to the streets to demand better police protection and a crackdown on ethnic uyghurs , who are blamed for the attacks .
police fired tear gas on demonstrators friday , a cnn affiliate reported .
armed security forces faced down protesters in front of chinese communist party offices and later in a public square , according to hong kong-based i-cable .
the state-run xinhua news agency reported a heavy security presence friday and helicopters hovering over urumqi , the capital of china 's xinjiang uyghur autonomous region .
people were stocking up groceries for fear of escalating violence , xinhua said .
a university student , fearful of being identified , told cnn that the city was cordoned off .
no traffic was running and schools were closed .
urumqi has been plagued by violence between han chinese and uyghurs since july , when long-simmering ethnic tensions erupted into riots .
the han chinese are the country 's dominant ethnic group ; the uyghurs are a turkic-speaking muslim minority who consider xinjiang their homeland .
unconfirmed reports of deaths in those riots range from 200 to many more .
" authorities have issued arrest warrants to 196 suspects and prosecuted 51 for involvement " in a july 5 riot , xinhua reported .
in recent weeks , hundreds of people from several ethnic groups have sought treatment for syringe stabbings by uyghurs .
" hospitals in urumqi are treating 531 victims of hypodermic needle attacks , " the state-run news agency said friday , citing local police.
" statistics from the city 's 24 hospitals say 106 of the 531 were showing obvious signs of needle attacks .
the victims include members of ethnic groups such as han , uygurand kazakstan . "
there have been no reports of deaths from the stabbings .
authorities have detained 21 suspects , " of whom six are in custody and four have been arrested for criminal prosecution , said the regional information office in a mobile phone text message to the public thursday , " xinhua reported .
the syringe attacks , which residents said began in early august , sparked the latest unrest .
" i heard that today , even during the protest , some people got stab bed , too , " a bank receptionist said thursday .
"people are angry that the government is not doing much against the uyghurs ' needle stabbing . "
another woman said the stabbings were ethnically motivated and that government text messages to citizens have warned that the syringes contained an unknown disease .
fears were likely heightened by the fact that xinjiang has the highest rates of hiv infection in china , attributed to intravenous drug use .
rumors have abounded there of people trying to spread aids .
according to the central asia caucasus institute at johns hopkins university in maryland , xinjiang serves as a convenient drug-trafficking route , lying between opium-growing regions of afghanistan and southeast asia and the heroin markets in central asia , russia and europe .
it is estimated that more than 60,000 people in xinjiang are hiv-positive .
the uyghur american association issued a statement late thursday urging the chinese government to improve public safety .
" i call on chinese officials to guarantee the security of all people living in east turkestan ( xinjiang ) , including uyghurs and han chines e , " said exiled uyghur activist rebiya kadeer , whom the chinese government has blamed for inciting the strife in july .
no answers , no arrests yet in death of yale student
new haven , connecticut ( cnn ) -- new haven police meticulously sifted through evidence tuesday in their search for the killer of yale student annie le , whose body was found sunday in a basement wall of a medical research building off campus .
a senior police official told cnn investigators have interviewed more than 200 people in the case but have not issued an arrest warrant nor have they identified a " person of interest " .
the official also disputed yale university president richard levin , who had indicated that the suspect pool would be a " limited number " of people who had been in the basement the day le disappeared .
" we know everyone that was in the basement ... and we passed that on to police , " levin said .
" there is an abundance of evidence . "
but the police official , whom cnn is not naming because of the sensitive nature of the ongoing investigation , said investigators believe dozens of people could have had access to that area of the building .
le , 24 , disappeared september 8 .
she was last seen on surveillance video as she entered the four-story lab at 10 amistad street , about 10 blocks from the main campus .
after going over hours of tapes , authorities said they had not found images of her leaving the building .
the police official said that investigators were unlikely to make any arrest until dna evidence is returned from analysis and that the probe could take days or weeks .
police have not released information on what dna evidence may have been found , although investigators said earlier that bloody clothing was found hidden above tiles in a drop ceiling in another part of the building .
authorities have not described the clothes that were found , nor said to whom they might have belonged .
teams of investigators at a connecticut state police lab worked through the weekend processing and examining the bloodstained clothes .
but thomas kaplan , editor in chief of the yale daily news , said a yale police official told the paper that the clothes were not what le was wearing when she entered the building .
on sunday , new haven police spokesman joe avery said that le 's killing was not a random act but would not elaborate .
meanwhile , a home in middletown , connecticut -- believed to be the home of a yale technician -- was the scene of a large police presence .
police , however , would not say whether their presence at the home was related to their investigation of le 's death .
le , a graduate student in yale 's pharmacology program , was to have been married sunday on new york 's long island to jonathan widawsky , a graduate student at columbia university .
her friend vanessa flores said she was overjoyed about getting married .
" she was just so excited about this wedding and everything from , you know , her flowers to her wedding dress and just certain details about it , " flores told hln 's nancy grace .
" we talked about this back in 2008 .
she was already thinking about the weather , whether june , july was going to be too hot , august , so september , would it be nice ? "
le was from placerville , california , and seemed to have been well aware of the risks of crime in a university town .
in february , she compared crime and safety at yale with other ivy league schools for a piece for b magazine , published by the medical school .
among the tips she offered : keep a minimum amount on your person .
when she walked over to the research building on september 8 , she left her purse , credit cards and cell phone in her office .
obama , new japanese leader hold first meeting
by kent klein
washington
23 september 2009
u.s. president barack obama and japan 's new prime minister yukio hatoyama have reaffirmed the importance of the u.s.-japanese alliance .
the two leaders met for the first time since mr. hatoyama took office last week .
despite prime minister yukio hatoyama 's campaign rhetoric , which signaled a possible japanese shift away from washington , he and president barack obama said their countries ' longstanding alliance will continue .
mr. obama said the relationship should be strengthened and deepened .
" it has been a cornerstone of the security of both nations , as well as the economic prosperity of both nations for almost 50 years now ," he said .
mr. hatoyama said tokyo 's relationship with the united states will be a " key pillar " of his policies .
after their talk on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly meeting in new york , mr. obama said the united states and japan have a major role in working with other countries toward economic recovery .
" as the world 's two largest economies , we recognize the importance of coordinating closely to continue to move beyond the current economic crisis , " he said .
both leaders stressed the need to coordinate closely on climate change , afghanistan , pakistan and north korea .
the japanese leader praised mr. obama 's leadership on nuclear nonproliferation , and pledged his support .
mr. obama did not mention the japanese leader 's sometimes anti-u.s. campaign remarks , and thanked mr. hatoyama for his " extraordinary campaign " .
tsunami death toll rises in southeast asia
30-sep-09
authorities say the death toll has risen to more than 110 from the tsunami generated in the south pacific by a powerful undersea earthquake .
the majority of the fatalities occurred in samoa , where rescue workers say at least 84 people were killed .
another 24 people are confirmed dead on american samoa , while at least seven fatalities have been reported in nearby tonga .
samoan prime minister tuilaepa sailele malielegaoi says he is shocked by the devastation .
he added , " so many people are gone . "
u.s. president barack obama declared a major disaster in american samoa and is sending federal aid to support local recovery efforts in the u.s. territory .
during a wednesday appearance near washington , mr. obama said the u.s. was ready to help its " friends " in neighboring samoa and throughout the region .
the u.s. geological survey says an 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck early tuesday local time .
it generated waves that devastated coastal areas , knocked down buildings and sent cars floating out to sea .
strong aftershocks followed the initial earthquake , with at least one measuring a magnitude 5.6 .
tsunami alerts were issued for the entire south pacific region but were later canceled .
survivors fled to high ground and stayed there for hours .
several villages were destroyed on the southern samoan coast of upolu , which is also home to many tourist resorts .
at the capital of american samoa , pago pago , the tsunami measured 1.57 meters in height .
the superintendent of the national park of american samoa mike reynolds reported four waves as high as six meters .
people who experienced the quake said it was long , lasting from 90 seconds to three minutes .
mekong dams could threaten aquatic life
plans to build a series of hydropower dams on the mekong river could threaten already endangered species in the waterway .
the mekong river is the lifeblood of southeast asia , with the largest inland fisheries in the world .
about 40 million people depend to some degree on the fisheries , worth about $ 2.5 billion a year .
but fisheries experts say plans by cambodia , laos and thailand to build hydropower dams on the mekong would block fish mig ration , threatening already endangered species .
environmental activists say plans by laos to build a dam in the don sahong area near the cambodian border could doom the nearly extinct irrawaddy dolphin .
soung ma earns money taking tourists for a rare glimpse of the dolphins .
" local people normally work in dolphin tourism .
everyone has a small boat and can pick up tourists and get money from tourists every day or every month depending on the season , " ma said .
the mekong river commission works to manage river resources among cambodia , laos , thailand , and vietnam .
jeremy bird heads the commission and says balancing the pros and cons of hydropower dams is the biggest challenge facing the mekong basin .
" we 're talking about the livelihoods of millions of people but we 're also talking about a huge potential resource of hydropower which can not only provide foreign revenues to the countries , but can those revenues can then be used to finance other development programs and help countries meet their targets on poverty alleviation and millenium development goals , " bird said .
some dams on rivers feeding the mekong have disrupted fish populations .
fishermen may have to turn to aquaculture like this tilapia farm in vientiane to make up for the lost wild catch .
suchart ingthamjitr , a program officer at the mrc 's fishery program , says fish farms help meet demand .
" the price of wild fish is higher than cultured fish .
but , the problem of wild fish is seaso nality , " ingthamjitr said .
" yeah , you can catch and have the wild fish depend on the time of year .
but , for tilapia all year round you can buy it in the market . "
as the sun sets on the mekong , fishermen try their luck .
environmental and fisheries experts say damming the mekong will change some of their traditional ways .
full picture of haiti devastation emerges as international aid mobilized
death , devastation and deprivation prevail in haiti 's capital , as the full extent of the country 's humanitarian crisis is being revealed to the world .
the international community is rushing aid to earthquake-ravaged port-au-prince in the face of logistical challenges and with the knowledge that haiti 's needs far outpace anything that can be delivered in the short-term .
two days after the 7.0 magnitude quake , the horror of the disaster is undiminished .
in port-au-prince , sheet-draped bodies remain unclaimed , and untold numbers of people are trapped in rubble or missing and feared dead .
the ranks of the injured seeking scarce medical attention continue to grow .
seemingly countless people lack food and shelter , leaving streets packed with increasingly hungry , destitute survivors .
even among those whose homes did not collapse , fear of aftershocks has led many to remain outdoors .
haitian president rene preval commented on the situation on nbc television 's today program .
" i am sure that i will not sleep in the street tonight .
but i am sure a lot of people will sleep in the street tonight , " he said .
haiti 's humanitarian crisis has sparked the biggest outpouring of international aid in response to a natural disaster since the 2004 tsunami that devastated parts of indonesia and surrounding nations .
the united states has mobilized thousands of troops and a massive contingent of civilian workers to respond to the haitian crisis .
speaking at the white house , president barack obama said the initial u.s. response will exceed $ 100 million , and that more assistance will be forthcoming .
" to the people of haiti , we say clearly and with conviction : you will not be forsaken .
you will not be forgotten .
in this , your hour of greatest need , america stands with you .
the world stands with you , " he said .
dozens of other nations and a vast array of international organizations and aid groups have also sprung to action .
assistance is being dispatched from around the globe , including many faraway nations .
israel , for example , is sending a military medical team that will operate a field hospital in haiti .
" israel has quite a lot of experience in these kinds of earthquakes , " said israeli military official , gidi shenar .
" we have been in several places in the world .
we are bringing our knowledge and we are coming to assist the people over there and save lives .
as fast as we can , we will be over there . "
but obstacles remain .
diplomats and aid officials familiar with haiti say that even before the quake , the country 's roads and infrastructure were in poor condition or virtually non-existent .
the temblor damaged port-au-prince 's international airport as well as the city 's seaport .
speaking on nbc 's today show , secretary of state hillary clinton said u.s. teams have had logistical challenges to overcome .
" we have the airport open , thanks to the u.s. military , " she said .
" we have our civilian search-and-rescue teams on the ground .
we are doing all we can . "
amid the devastation and loss of life in haiti , there have been a precious few moments of joy - u.s. rescue workers pulled a security guard out of the rubble of the collapsed u.n. building in port-au-prince .
but scores of u.n. personnel remain unaccounted for .
shaken and frail , one woman was asked her reaction after family members rescued her from a collapsed house .
" i started crying .
yeah , i started crying , " she said .
haiti is the western hemisphere 's poorest nation , long-plagued by frequent hurricanes , political instability and chronic underdevelopment .
obama 's presidency a living example for african americans
a majority of african-americans also say that mr. obama 's presidential win has improved race relations in america .
a new survey shows that african-americans ' assessment of progress and race relations in america has improved more dramatically than at any time in the last quarter century .
and , president barack obama 's move into the white house appears to be the spark that ignited this rise in optimism and hope .
african-american nicole cunningham says growing up in the southern state of georgia was difficult .
it was a time of racial tension .
the white supremacist group , often terrorized black families , sometimes beating and murdering them .
but , nicole says seeing the inauguration of the first black president has shown her that times have changed .
" when i was in the fifth grade having the kkk march on my school , and wanting to have all the black kids brought outside , i was thinking about all of that when i was looking up there .
so we have definitely come a long way , " she said .
nicole and her husband , vurtis , took their two young children to the inauguration to witness the historic event .
their son tarik says he is proud of mr. obama 's victory .
" and i know some people they did n't like the idea of having an african-american president and he persevered through all that , " he said .
" it was a very emotional day , " said nicole . "
you know , i can look up there and see someone who looks like me . "
a new survey by the pew research center shows that nearly twice as many african-americans now than in 2007 say the situation of black people in the united states has improved over the last five years .
this jump in optimism is the highest seen since 1984 .
a majority of african-americans also say that mr. obama 's presidential win has improved race relations in america .
but the national association for the advancement of colored people 's chairman julian bond says it was one moment in a long chain of events .
" it 's arguable you could say , that we should have been able to do this years and years and years ago , " said bond . "
but perhaps it had to wait for the moment , for the man , for the moment-it did have to wait for the man and the moment and had to wait for an awful lot of work that had to be done leading up to this moment . "
the inauguration of barack obama at the steps of the capitol was more than just a beginning to a new presidency .
for the cunninghams and many african-americans , mr. obama was a living example of the endless possibilities .
" so to grow up , and to tell my kids that they can be anything they want to be in the world , there 's no barriers anymore , you can go as far as you want to go , and to have this culminate before us , and we 're there to see it , just unreal , surreal , " said vurtis .
for the next generation of cunninghams , like their 11-year-old daughter gwen , the realization of the first black president is already taking effect .
" it lets me know that i can run for president , because i am an african american and , and i can become the first female president , " said gwen .
the cunninghams " are still smiling over president obama 's successful jump over the race barrier .
but they say the economy and the ongoing wars are tough problems he needs to tackle .
" there 's still life going on , but we are still very excited .
and we wish the president well ," said cunninghams . "
he definitely has his work cut out for him .
he definitely does . "
mr. obama is trying a more hands-on approach to help address these problems and will present his plans later this month in his state of the union address .
strong earthquake shakes haiti again
a strong earthquake has again struck haiti , shaking buildings and causing panic as international efforts to help those affected by last week 's devastating quake continued .
there have been no reports of injuries from the magnitude 6.1 quake wednesday .
the united states is sending more ships to haiti to help with recovery from last week 's 7.0 magnitude earthquake , which killed an estimated 200,000 people .
this will include a vessel designed to clear debris blocking the main port in the capital , port-au-prince .
the debris has prevented larger ships with food and other vital supplies from making deliveries .
some damaged buildings in the haitian capital have been ransacked by people searching for supplies as they await more relief .
american troops have been providing security for food and water deliveries .
about 3,500 additional u.n. security personnel are also being sent to haiti to help prevent looting .
the world food program says it will try to get fresh aid to as many people as possible wednesday .
but officials say relief efforts have been hampered by blocked roads , bureaucratic confusion and the collapse of local authority .
survivors have been living in makeshift camps on streets littered with debris and decomposing bodies .
doctors are struggling to treat thousands of injured with limited resources .
search and rescue teams from several countries have freed 90 people buried under collapsed buildings , including an elderly woman on tuesday who was trapped under rubble for a full week .
officials estimate the earthquake affected an estimated three million -- about a third of haiti 's population .
after 2008 scare , china finds more toxic milk products
by reuters - mon jan 25
beijing ( reuters ) - authorities in southwestern china have ordered three batches of milk products off shelves because they contain a chemical that killed at least six children in 2008 , causing global concern over the made-in-china brand .
the health department in guizhou province stopped the sales of dairy products made by three chinese companies , the state-run china daily newspaper said .
the products were found to contain melamine , which can cause kidney stones and is meant for making plastics , fertilizers and even concrete .
its high nitrogen content allows protein levels to appear higher when it is added to milk or animal feed .
guizhou health authorities were unavailable for comment .
china executed two people in november for their role in a huge melamine-tainted milk scandal that killed at least six children and sullied the made-in-china brand .
nearly 300,000 children fell ill in that scandal in 2008 after drinking milk intentionally laced with melamine , sold mainly in that case by the now bankrupt sanlu group .

vietnam pledges to ensure children 's rights
investing in children to exercise their right to live , to be protected , and to grow is investing in the future , said deputy prime minister nguyen sinh hung at a ceremony in hanoi on february 23 to mark the 20th anniversary of vietnam 's adoption of the international convention on the rights of the child .
twenty years after approving the convention , vietnam is making great effort to implement its socio-economic development plans which will help ensure children 's rights in education and healthcare .
so far , 20 percent of communes and wards around country have achieved their targets in making homes , schools and communities " children-friendly " .
at a conference on the convention , representatives of ministries and sectors involved in childcare and education discussed issues related to the role of the party , the state and the national assembly in implementing the convention and in integrating child targets into the country 's development plans .
in his speech , mr hung said vietnam 's achievements in carrying out the convention over the past years were due to its cooperation with other committed countries and international organisations .
vietnam is committed to implementing children 's rights and desires closer cooperation with other countries , international and non-governmental organisations in protecting vietnamese children 's rights .
the assumption of the asean chair in 2010 will put vietnam in a position to make stronger contributions to children 's rights , benefiting children in vietnam , asean and the world .
to reach the goals of the convention , vietnam 's party and state should focus on poverty reduction to narrow the socioeconomic gap between regions and enable children to enjoy their full rights , insisted mr hung .
search for survivors continues after chile massive quake
rescue workers are tearing through the rubble in search of survivors in chile sunday , a day after a massive earthquake shattered the country 's central region .
the 8.8 magnitude quake struck the south american country saturday in the early morning hours .
many chileans have continued to stay out of their homes because of the jolting series of aftershocks , some as strong as 6.9 magnitude .
the quake has killed more than 300 people and damaged as many as 1.5 million homes .
officials say the death toll is expected to rise .
rescuers are working to reach about a 100 people trapped in an apartment building that collapsed in concepcion , the country 's second-largest city .
the main rescue operation is centered in the city , about 100 kilometers from the epicenter of the quake .
looters ransacked stores in concepcion sunday , stealing both food and electrical appliances .
police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse a crowd of looters at one supermarket .
chilean president michelle bachelet declared a " state of catastrophe " in central chile , where the quake toppled buildings , overturned cars and brought down power and phone lines .
bridges fell and many streets were covered with rubble .
fires were reported .
several hospitals collapsed .
the president has not asked for assistance from other countries , but several nations have offered to send aid .
speaking at the vatican sunday , pope benedict said he is praying for the people of chile and other populations in the pacific tested by the calamity .
the earthquake has raised a daunting first challenge for billionaire sebastian pinera , who was elected chile 's president in january .
he takes office in two weeks .
chile 's children who were preparing to return to school monday at the end of their summer break have had their vacation extended another week .
in the capital , santiago , officials closed the international airport because of damage .
argentina and other parts of south america also felt the earthquake .
while cell phone communication was knocked out by the quake , many people used social networking sites such as twitter and facebook to reach out to friends and loved ones .
the u.s. geological survey says an earthquake with a magnitude of 8 or more is classified as a " great " earthquake that can cause tremendous damage .
the biggest earthquake ever recorded struck the same area of chile in 1960 .
it had a magnitude of 9.5 and also set off a tsunami , which had devastating effects in pacific countries including japan and the philippines , where at least 1,600 people were killed .
thai demonstrators hold " bloody " protest
protesters have poured blood at the thai government 's administrative building and governing party headquarters in a gesture calling for the government to resign .
the national human rights commission is in talks between the protesters and government in bid to open a dialogue and negotiation .
in a symbolic demonstration , protesters poured human blood at the main gate of the thai government administrative building and later at the headquarters of the governing democrat party .
the red-dressed protesters have been demanding the government of prime minister abhisit vejjajiva to stand down and call fresh elections .
the blood had been drawn from hundreds of protesters as part of a campaign against the government that has seen over 100,000 demonstrators assembled in bangkok since late last week .
sean boonpracong , the red shirts " international spokesman , says at least 20,000 protesters donated blood with the rituals targeting the government which he says came to power with the backing of the army .
we had a week of it and , then the whiskey gave out .
it had been a prosperous season .
he says the protesters will consider civil disobedience as a further step .
many of the protesters , who are demanding the government step down , are supporters of former prime minister thaksin shinawatra .
but prime minister abhisit has refused to dissolve parliament , with coalition partners saying they will stand by the democrat party .
national human right commission chairperson amaran pengsapij met with red-shirt leaders .
amaran said the talks were aimed at achieving reconciliation with the government .
" yes , two steps ; one is establish dialogue between different stakeholders and the goal of course is to stop the rally . " said the chairperson .
amaran is to meet with the government wednesday .
most of the protesters are from outside bangkok , especially the poorer northern provinces that remain a strong thaksin-support base .
thaksin has been living in exile to avoid a two-year jail term for corruption and abuse of power gained widespread support through populist policies while in power .
he was overthrown in 2006 by the military .
child mortality highlights china 's rural divide
thu mar 25 , 08:06 pm et
hong kong ( reuters ) – children born in rural china are three to six times more likely to die before they turn 5 than those in the cities , a study found , highlighting the wide gulf in healthcare provision for the rich and poor in china .
pneumonia , birth asphyxia , and nterm birth complications were the leading causes of death in children under 5 , the researchers said in a paper published on friday in the lancet .
led by igor rudan at the croatian center for global health in split , croatia , the researchers searched public databases containing information from 1990 to 2008 , including 206 long-term studies on causes of death in children under 5 .
according to the paper , child mortality rates dived 71 percent from 64.6 to 18.5 per 1,000 livebirths from 1990 to 2008 , but the disparity between child health in the booming cities compared with the poor countryside remained stark .
" the progress toward reduction of the child mortality rate in china is strongly determined by the degree of socioeconomic development " .
the chinese government says it has been working to address this inequity since 2003 , putting in place a modest healthcare insurance system that it hopes will help the poorest meet basic medical needs .
in 2009 , beijing launched a new reform , pledging $ 123 billion over the next three years to provide universal and affordable basic healthcare for 1.3 billion population .
in an interview with reuters last week , chinese health minister chen zhu said the insurance program has been extended to much of the population .
" now we are a 1.33 billion-population , and 1.23 billion are covered .
some 100 million are not covered , these are migrants , elderly people and children in cities and people in small enterprises , " chen said .
" i hope that next year , a part of these 100 million people who are still uninsured .... will be brought in . "
under china 's household registration system , hundreds of millions of migrants from the countryside are unable to obtain residency status that would give them access to healthcare , education or legal protection in the cities where they settle .

china rushes aid to victims of powerful earthquake
western china has been rocked by a powerful earthquake and strong aftershocks , which have claimed more than 400 lives .
more than 10,000 people have been injured and many more people may be trapped in damaged buildings .
the earthquake struck the western chinese province of qinghai early wednesday , collapsing buildings in villages around this region .
the china earthquake administration estimates the quake as being a 7.1 magnitude , while the u.s. geological survey puts it at 6.9 .
the quake struck just before 8 in the morning in the mountainous and remote western area , which divides qinghai province and tibet .
a second strong quake struck about five minutes later , state media say , destroying 85 percent of the buildings in one township near the epicenter .
children are among those reported as trapped and many injured people be seen in the street with bleeding head wounds .
an armed police detachment in qinghai , shi huajie , told chinese state tv some 600 rescuers are scrambling to save the many people are buried in yushu county .
but he says a lack of organization is slowing their efforts .
shi says the earthquake stuck when many people were still asleep - and he says the rescue effort is also being hampered by the lack of heavy lifting equipment .
telecommunications have been disrupted and roads from the nearest airport are badly damaged .
rescue equipment is being rushed to the high altitude area .
the quake comes nearly two years after the massive western sichuan earthquake , which claimed 68,000 lives .
that quake sparked protests among residents who said the poor quality of buildings was to blame for the large number of casualties , especially children who died when their schools collapsed .
china 's earthquake history

oil spill spreads fears along us gulf coast
five years ago this august , hurricane katrina struck .
now , american states along the gulf of mexico are fearing a different kind of environmental disaster .
oil is flowing from a damaged well 1500 meters under the sea .
janet napolitano : " this is a spill of national significance . "
that was homeland security secretary janet napolitano , announcing a higher level of government action .
president obama on thursday ordered federal officials to intensify efforts to deal with the huge spill .
the deepwater horizon oil drilling rig exploded and sank last week .
eleven workers are missing .
british petroleum leased the rig , owned by switzerland-based transocean .
the president said again friday that bp is " ultimately responsible " under the law for paying all the costs of response and cleanup operations .
barack obama : " but we are fully prepared to meet our responsibilities to help all affected communities . "
he has ordered a report in thirty days on what , if any , additional safety measures and technologies should be required to prevent future spills .
oil reached the coastline late thursday near the mouth of the mississippi river in the southern state of louisiana .
this oil could also affect parts of alabama , florida , mississippi and texas .
it threatens birds , fish , shrimp and other wildlife .
seafood is a big industry along the gulf .
eric drury is a shrimper but knows that his business is not the only one threatened .
eric drury : " everybody 's in the same boat .
it 's going to hurt everything : oyster fisherman , everybody . "
workers have been placing long lengths of containment booms around the oil as winds and waves push it toward shore .
cleanup efforts have included controlled burns .
and robotic submarines are being used to try to stop the leak -- a process that could take weeks .
what caused the explosion was not known .
also , the damaged well did not stop the flow of oil .
at the end of march , president obama called for the united states to expand offshore oil and gas exploration .
he said this plan would balance the need for energy with the need to protect natural resources .
now the white house says there will be no additional drilling while the spill in the gulf of mexico is investigated .
another issue facing the administration this was immigration .
federal law makes being in united states illegally a civil offense .
but a new state law in arizona will make it's a crime .
this law was signed last week and goes into effect in a few months .
police could have to take action if they have a " reasonable suspicion " that someone is in this country illegally .
supporters say this law will help reduce crime by illegal immigrants who cross the border from mexico into arizona .
critics say it will support racial discrimination .
some urge economic boycotts of the state .
different groups are moving to fight this new law in court , and the federal government could join them .
president obama calls this arizona law " misguided " and said congress needs to pass immigration reform .
but in this election year , that does not seem very likely to happen .
britain has new prime minister
britain has a new prime minister and a new government as five days of political deadlock has come to an end .
prime minister gordon brown resigned as britain 's top politician on tuesday evening , making way for conservative leader david cameron .
queen elizabeth appointed conservative leader david cameron as the prime minister tuesday evening .
he is to form a coalition government with britain 's third largest party the liberal democrats , ending 13 years of labor leadership.
speaking outside his new residence - number 10 downing street - mr. cameron said the road ahead wo n't be easy .
" this is going to be hard and difficult work ," said david cameron .
" a coalition will throw up all sorts of challenges but i believe together we can provide that strong and stable government that our country needs . "
he said he wanted a proper and full coalition to sort out britain 's financial deficit , its social problems , and problems in the political system .
outgoing prime minister gordon brown handed his own resignation to the queen earlier in the evening .
before leaving downing street with his wife and two children , mr. brown said he had loved his job .
" in the face of many challenges in a very few short years - challenges up to and including the global financial meltdown - i have always strived to serve , to do my best in the interest in britain , its values and its people ," said gordon brown .
mr. brown 's unexpected resignation brings to an end five days of political upheaval in britain .
a general election last week saw the conservative party win the most votes but turned out no clear majority winner .
since then the conservatives and labor have jockeyed for the support of the third largest party in order to form a coalition strong enough to take power .
the party in the middle , the liberal democrats , sided with the conservatives - ending any hope labor might have had that it could hold on to power .
the exact details of the new government were not immediately clear .
tony travers from the london school of economics says the events of the past week are very rare in britain .
" well this is a new departure , " said tony travers .
" we do n't have coalition governments or anything like this normally .
and this will require a great deal of work .
but now they 're in power they 're going to be forced to make it work , at least for a while . "
the conservatives and the liberal democrats are at odds on a number of major policies including on immigration , the european union , and the economy .
43-year-old david cameron will be britain 's youngest prime minister in 200 years .

mangalore airport lies on top of a hill with steep drops at the end of each of its two runways .
one of the runways was extended in 2006 to accommodate larger planes like the boeing 737 .
the airline said the plane had overshot the runway as it came into land at about 06:00 ( 00:30 gmt ) and crashed into a wooded valley .
tv pictures showed rescue workers and local villagers scrambling on steep hillsides to search the smoking wreckage .
a mangalore police official told the bbc that smoke from the crash site had made it difficult for rescue workers to gain access to the plane .
" as far as the information available with us is concerned , eight persons were rescued and shifted to local hospitals in mangalore for treatment , " air india official anup shrivasta told reporters .
mr patel said one person was unharmed , four had minor injuries and three were being treated for major injuries .
one passenger , described as a seven-year-old boy , died on the way to hospital .
officials said 146 bodies had so far been recovered , some burned beyond recognition .
warnings
a light pre-monsoon rain was reported to be falling at the time but the head of the indian airport authority , vp agarwal , said visibility was not a problem .
he said the pilot had given no distress call to the control tower .
local media named the pilot as serbian zlatko glusica .
he was said to have 10,000 hours of flying time , including experience of mangalore 's airport .
afp news agency said mr glusica also had british citizenship .
the civil aviation minister said an investigation had been ordered into the crash , and that the flight data and voice " black box " recorders had not been found .
after visiting the scene of the crash , mr patel observed that mangalore airport had a short runway and a limited area after that to accommodate planes that overshot the landing strip .
he said the air india express flight had missed its landing threshold by about 2,000 feet ( 600 metres ) .
" because the spill-over area was limited , it went off a cliff , " he said .
mr patel added that one of the plane 's wings had hit a navigational aid near the end of the runway called a localiser and broke off before the rest of the plane plunged into the valley .
there have been cautions before about the position of mangalore 's runways , which analysts say poses challenges for pilots .
a former adviser to the civil aviation ministry said he had given warnings in the past about the airport and said it should not be used by bigger aircraft such as the boeing 737 .
" the problems are there , that if you overshoot , if your brakes fail or if you ca n't stop the aircraft for any reason , then it will fall and roll over the cliff into the valley with disastrous consequences , and that is what happened today here , " said air marshal denzil keelor .
' i just jumped '
one of the survivors , kp manikutty , said the landing had at first appeared to be smooth and then the plane had crashed with no warning .
" immediately on touching the ground , the aircraft jerked and in a few moments hit something " .
" then it split in the middle and caught fire .
i just jumped from the gap , " he added .
air india express began operations about five years ago as an offshoot of the state-run air india .
its boeing 737-800 jet that crashed was less than three years old .
india 's air safety record has been good in the past decade , despite a rapid increase in the number of private airlines and air travel in the country .
the last major crash happened in the city of patna in july 2000 , killing at least 50 people .
human trafficking a problem in major cities across us
each year since two thousand one , the american state department has published a trafficking in persons report .
it measures efforts by countries to fight human trafficking .
this year 's report , out monday , adds the united states for the first time .
the federal bureau of investigation says people are being trafficked into major cities nationwide .
tim whittman at the f.b.i. is an expert on the problem .
he says about twenty percent of the cases involve victims from mexico -- the largest number of any foreign country .
bradley myles is with the polaris project , an organization that fights trafficking .
he calls it " a very serious problem in the united states . " he says some of the victims are forced to work in homes of the wealthy and at restaurants .
activists say some cases of modern slavery involve forced labor in agriculture .
but more than eighty percent of suspected incidents involve the sex trade .
that was the finding of a study by the human smuggling and trafficking center , established by congress .
the polaris project operates a telephone hotline that receives calls from around the country -- from states such as texas , california , new york and florida .
bradley myles says one of the top five cities where calls come from is washington .
victims in the nation 's capital include women from south korea , china and latin america .
some victims are american citizens .
tim whittman from the f.b.i. says illegal sex businesses often limit their customers to avoid being caught .
tim whittman : " if a person , for example , from korea is brought in to the united states under false pretenses and then forced into prostitution , very much that place where the prostitution occurs is within , then , the korean community in the united states . "
deborah sigmund started a group called innocents at risk .
she says most of the victims of human trafficking come from economically troubled countries .
deborah sigmund : " they want to think that they can come to america and have a great job , so it 's very easy to fool them . "
tim whittman says the smugglers often threaten their victims and make it difficult for them to pay their debts .
the threat may be against their family back in their home country .
but there are other ways to pressure victims to stay .
tim whittman : " a common threat is 'if you leave , i 'm going to report you to immigration and you 'll be arrested .
you 'll be kept in prison for a long time .' "
but in reality , there is help .
victims of human trafficking can sometimes get a special visa .
it permits them to stay in the united states for up to four years .
during that time , they can request to stay permanently .
but with threats , a language barrier and fear of the legal system , victims are often unwilling or unable to seek help .
death toll in chinese floods rises above 1,000
the death toll from weeks of flooding and mudslides in china has risen above 1,000 .
officials said wednesday that 1,072 people have been recorded as dead and more than 600 are missing .
twenty eight provinces and some 140 million people have been affected by the flooding .
new concern on the two rivers that form china 's border with north korea , where the xinhua news agency says water levels are at dangerous levels .
flooding on the yalu and tumen rivers could bring devastation to impoverished north korea .
flooding in china 's jilin border province has already killed at least 74 people and forced the evacuation of 800,000 .
no reports on the impact in isolated north korea .
chinese premier wen jiabao visited affected areas tuesday and wednesday in jilin , which is home to a large ethnic korean community .
chinese officials say this has been one of the worst years for flooding in the last 100 years .
economic losses have been estimated at more than $ 30 billion , according to xinhua , with more rain predicted .
japan marks bomb anniversary
japan is commemorating the victims of the atomic bomb that devastated hiroshima 65 years ago .
the attack by the united states in 1945 was instrumental in ending world war ii .
since then on each on august 6 , a somber echo of a temple bell reverberates through hiroshima 's peace memorial park .
japan is the only nation ever to have been attacked with atomic bombs .
more than 140,000 people were killed instantly in hiroshima or died in the days and weeks after the u.s attack .
three days later , a u.s plane dropped a second atomic bomb on nagasaki , killing more than 70,000 people .
japan surrendered on august 14 .
" their dreams , hopes and bodies were all killed by the bomb , " said sadae kasaoka , a 77-year-old survivor of the hiroshima blast .
" when the remaining dead bodies were being burned , kasaoka said " i felt like i could see their spirits .
i want to live my life to make up for the part of theirs they couldn't live .
i feel that my role has become to live and tell everyone knows a tragic and miserable situation it actually was . "
unique ceremony
japan sees itself as a victim of the u.s. decision to drop an atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki .
the united states has never apologized for the bombings , and u.s domestic public opinion holds that it was a necessary step to end the war .
stephen leeper is the chairperson of the hiroshima peace culture foundation .
he says no future use of atomic weapons should ever occur .
by any definition , they were a war crime , so i am down on those bombings , " leeper said .
" however , i am not going to make an issue of that with any american or ambassador or government official or anybody else because that is not the point .
the point is how do we keep it from happening again . "
the ceremony this year stood out from past memorial events with the presence of the u.s ambassador to japan , john roos .
he is the first official u.s. representative ever to attend the peace ceremony in hiroshima .
the u.s state department simply said mr. roos was representing the united states " to express regret for all of the victims of world war ii . "
also at this year 's ceremony was ban moon , the first u.n secretary-general to attend .
mr ban said he hoped his attendance would " send a strong message to the world and also give some opportunity of addressing the sufferings and concerns of many of hundreds of thousands of whose admiration and dream is to see the world free of nuclear weapons . "
leeper said he was thrilled the attention this 65th anniversary is receiving .
" having ambassador roos here , and ban moon , secretary-general ban moon come here for the first time .
this is the first general ever to come to this ceremony , " he said .
" this is a tremendous event for us , and we are very excited about it not because of the prestige it gives us , but because we think this is a change in how the world is thinking about nuclear weapons , " leeper said .
boost to relations
tokyo has often asked washington to send an envoy to this annual ceremony .
the ambassador 's attendance at hiroshima has caused some controversy in the united states .
japan had first attacked the united states with an aerial assault on pearl harbor , hawaii .
as the war progressed , many in the united states felt the decisive use of nuclear weapons actually saved lives by preventing a bloody invasion of japan .
u.s president harry truman gave the order to drop the bombs .
since then , u.s presidents have not ruled out the use of nuclear weapons , but only as a last resort .
now , president barack obama has called for a world free of the weapons .
" the united states will take concrete steps towards a world without nuclear weapons , " the president said .
" to put an end to cold war thinking , we will reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy , and urge others to do the same .
make no mistake , as long as these weapons exist , the united states will maintain a safe weapons , secure and effective arsenal to deter any adversary , "
the visit by ambassador roos friday also provides a needed boost to japan relations in the wake of a tense period between the two allies that stemmed from the previous japanese government 's wavering over an agreement to relocate a controversial u.s marine airbase in okinawa .
hurricane earl closing in on us east coast
hurricane earl is quickly closing in on a large part of the u.s east coast , forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate from barrier islands in the u.s state of north carolina .
while the eye of the category four ( on a scale of five ) storm is not expected to make a u.s landfall , the hurricane is on course to lash the coast of north carolina late thursday before shifting to the north .
hurricane and tropical storm warnings and watches are in effect along the mid-atlantic coast and as far north as maine .
national hurricane center forecasters say the storm has sustained winds of 220 kilometers per hour and they warn that waves pushed onto shore by the winds could raise water levels along the coast as much as 1.5 meters .
the governors of north carolina , virginia and maryland have declared states of emergency .
president barack obama also has declared a state of emergency in north carolina , allowing the federal government to coordinate disaster relief efforts there .
earl already has skirted parts of the eastern caribbean , flooding parts of antigua , ripping out trees and blowing down power lines on st martin .
officials in the u.s virgin islands and puerto rico say they are working to restore electricity to more than 200,000 people .
the national hurricane center in miami also is watching another tropical storm system that is expected to pass near bermuda by early saturday .
a third storm has weakened and is now a tropical depression moving slowly toward the lesser antilles islands .
us to send flood aid to north korea
north korea is struggling with heavy rains and massive flooding that have washed out homes and ruined crops across the country .
the worst flooding is in the north , on the yalu river , which separates north korea from china .
beijing has already offered help , and now the united states is , too .
robert king , the u.s. special envoy for north korean human rights , told voa 's korean service in an exclusive interview that washington will send $ 750,000 in emergency aid to pyongyang .
he said the money will be given to three independent aid groups : samaritan 's purse , global resource services and mercy corps .
" we 've received reports of the seriousness of the flooding in north korea , " king said .
" the north korean government reached out to these three non-government organizations that we 're working with and to another ngo and requested assistanc e . "
king added the groups will use the money primarily for medical supplies and will fly the aid into pyongyang beginning this week .
the aid comes amid a flurry of diplomatic activity surrounding north korea .
washington has imposed additional sanctions on pyongyang in response to the deadly sinking of a south korean war ship earlier this year .
and former u.s. president jimmy carter recently traveled to north korea to secure the release of an american jailed for illegally entering the country .
king dismissed speculation that the assistance is a political tool to lure north korea back to international talks on its nuclear program .
"our humanitarian assistance is provided solely on the basis of the need and our ability to provide the assistance and to monitor that it 's being received by those in need , " he said .
" this is not in response to ongoing talks or lack of talks .
this is not in response to the humanitarian release of an american citizen . "
washington 's outreach is likely timed with major leadership changes taking place in north korea , said aidan foster-carter , a korea expert and honorary research fellow with leeds university in england .
" i do think there 's a sense in washington and in seoul of possibly missing out at a time when north korea is probably going to be making a generational change , " said foster-carter .
north korea 's ruling w orkers ' party is reportedly planning a major meeting next week to pick new leadership and possibly choose a successor to leader kim jong il .
in the run-up to this meeting , mr. kim made his second visit to china in four months , coinciding with a visit to north korea by the former u.s. president carter .
foster-carter says by ignoring calls to return to the six-party talks , and working directly with china , north korea is signaling it does not care to deal with its critics .
" presumably neither the u.s. nor south korea wants to see north korea shelter wholly under china 's wing , which i think is certainly one option in the coming years to be honest , " foster-carter said .
china 's vice minister for foreign affairs , wu dawei , met key u.s. diplomats in washington this week to discuss north korea .
and south korea 's special representative for korean peninsula peace is to hold his own meeting friday with deputy u.s. secretary of state james steinberg .
state department spokesman p.j. crowley has said it is up to north korea to show it is willing to live up to international obligations , including abandoning its nuclear weapons program .
" if north korea 's prepared to demonstrate a willingness to act more constructively , then we will respond appropriately and be prepared for further engagement , " said crow ley .
in china last week , kim jong il reportedly told chinese president hu jintao that he wanted an early resumption of the nuclear talks .
the united states and south korea both say the negotiations should not resume until north korea apologizes for the sinking of the south korean warship .
many obstacles to a final middle east peace deal
after the first private sessions , photographs were issued showing palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu deep in conversation .
apparently they spoke in english .
no translators , the state department said , were present .
the message was that face-to-face contact had started and might even work , though a year of effort lies ahead .
and a lot more talk .
the next meeting is in two weeks time .
if you go by past history - and almost every israeli and palestinian i spoke to on a trip to the region last week did - then you will expect the talks to come to nothing .
after all , it has been almost 20 years since the first of several peace processes started .
all the years of failure have turned this into a long-running middle eastern saga of lost hope .
the americans are telling both sides that time is running out , that they cannot postpone the hard choices that making peace entails any longer .
it may be difficult , they 're saying , but it will be even worse if you do n't agree on the borders of a palestinian state and decide the other big issues .
the hardest ones are the future of jerusalem and finding justice for the millions of palestinians whose families lost their homes in 1948 in what became israel .
at the moment there is a big gulf between the public positions of the two sides .
the first hurdle for the americans has been surmounted .
they got the two leaders together and , in the words of one official , they did n't throw any chairs at each other .
from now on it gets harder .
here are some of the questions that need an answer .
hamas 's grisly reminder
what happens after 26 september ?
that is the day when israel 's partial freeze on building for jewish settlers in the occupied west bank ends .
israel says it will not be extended .
the palestinians say if it is not , they will walk away from the talks .
the americans are working hard to find a way ahead .
one suggestion is that mr netanyahu will say the freeze is not being extended but will assure the palestinians privately that no new developments will be authorised .
that kind of arrangement probably would not last long , but perhaps long enough to keep mr abbas talking .
what about hamas ?
the palestinian group were not invited to the talks and say they would not have come if they had been .
they have condemned the talks as a fraud .
hamas says mr abbas , whose electoral term has expired without a fresh poll , has no right to represent the palestinian people .
earlier this week , hamas killed four jewish settlers not far from hebron in the west bank .
it is looking as if they did not expect to stop the talks .
instead they were sending a grisly reminder of what they are prepared to do .
' israel 's gorbachev '
if hamas is as capable as it claims of sustained violence despite the attentions of the israelis and the security forces of president ab bas 's palestinian authority , it will have what amounts to a right of veto .
past negotiations failed because of the combination of problems at the negotiating table and the spilling of blood on the streets of israel and the occupied territories .
at the moment the idea at the talks seems to be to ignore hamas in the hope that a deal would be so attractive to the palestinian people that the group would powerless to oppose it .
that is not a very robust strategy .
it relies on a lot going right , quite quickly .
will mr netanyahu 's right-wing government veto any concessions ?
it is quite likely , if concessions involve jerusalem or occupied land his coalition partners believe should stay under jewish control .
mr netanyahu chose to form a right-wing coalition .
if he is serious about the talks , he may need a new one , one more amenable to paying the necessary price for peace .
is mr netanyahu serious ?
there is a debate in israel about what exactly he wants .
some believe he is an ideologue who is just reacting to american pressure to play for time .
the talks will not get far if he sticks to the preconditions he cited when he said a year ago he wanted peace through the establishment of a palestinian state .
but others believe he is ready to do a deal .
one leading israeli journalist recently wrote a long piece comparing him to mikhail gorbachev , the leader who was installed to save the soviet union and ended up dismantling it .
the suggestion was that mr netanyahu could do the same for the israeli occupation of the palestinian territories .
obama 's gamble
israel is the strong side .
it is in possession of the occupied territories and will have to give most of them up if this is going to work .
the palestinians at the talks are weak .
it will be easy , and politically cost-free , for the americans to twist palestinian arms .
twisting israeli arms will become necessary too .
that can be politically costly in the us.
the obama administration is taking a gamble .
the calculation is that it is worth it , that the other intractable problems in the middle east will be easier to deal with if the process goes well .
glory lies ahead for a president who can deliver real peace ( though not the nobel prize , which mr obama already holds , somewhat prematurely . )
but failure , at a time when the region is fast-changing and unstable , could make matters in the middle east much worse .
the americans have given the new talks between the palestinian president and the israeli prime minister the biggest launch they can - meetings with president obama , a dinner at the white house with the king of jordan and the egyptian president , and a globally televised first session at the us department of state .
us pastor terry jones cancels koran burning
the pastor of a small us church who planned to burn copies of the koran on the anniversary of 9 11 has cancelled his protest .
terry jones said he was calling off the event after the group behind a planned islamic centre near ground zero in new york agreed to relocate it .
but the cultural centre 's organisers said they had no plans to move it .
mr jones ' plan had been internationally condemned and had already sparked many protests around the world .
us defence secretary robert gates had telephoned him to urge him to reconsider his plans .
the pastor had also been visited several times by the fbi .
mr jones , pastor of the dove world outreach center in gainesville , florida , which has fewer than 50 members , had named saturday " international burn a koran day " .
but at a news conference , he said he was now dropping the plans and urged his supporters to do the same .
" we would right now ask no one to burn korans .
we are absolutely strong on that .
it is not the time to do it , " he said .
he said he would travel to new york on saturday to meet those behind the islamic centre , saying they had " agreed to move the location " .
" the american people do not want the mosque there , and , of course , muslims do not want us to burn the koran , " he said .
" if it 's not moved , then i think islam is a very poor example of religion .
i think that would be very pitiful .
i do not expect that . "
' no agreement '
mr jones was joined at his news conference by muhammad musri from the islamic foundation of central florida .
mr musri said he and mr jones had committed to travelling to new york " to come to a decision on moving the mosque " .
" we are committed to dissolving the situation here and there , " he said .
he also thanked mr jones for his " courage and his willingness to take these serious events that are unfolding " .
but the organisers of the new york centre said no agreement had been reached with mr jones .
leader of the new york project , imam feisal abdul rauf issued a statement saying he welcomed the cancellation of the koran burning .
" however , i have not spoken to pastor jones or imam musri, " he added .
" we are not going to toy with our religion or any other .
nor are we going to barter .
we are here to extend our hands to build peace and harmony . "
mr musri clarified to reporters that no guarantees about moving the islamic centre had been given .
he and mr jones had only agreed to fly to new york to discuss the location of the islamic centre with imam feisal abdul rauf .
plans for the islamic centre have prompted fierce debate in the us because of its proximity to the scene of the 9 1 1 terror attacks .
president barack obama had earlier warned mr jones the proposed burning would be " a recruitment bonanza " for al-qaeda .
the us state department had warned us citizens of an increased risk of attack , while international police organisation interpol also issued a warning of the risk of violent response .
malaysia opens ' hatch ' for abandoned babies
the cries of an abandoned baby boy echo in the nursery at orphancare , a malaysian charity that helps orphans find adoptive parents .
he is the only child here and does not have a name .
but in many ways he is seen as one of the lucky ones .
he was left in a baby " hatch " - the first in the country - designed to allow mothers to leave their babies anonymously .
the charity hopes it will rescue more unwanted newborns , as the authorities seek to stem the rising number of abandoned babies .
close to 500 babies have been found abandoned since 2005 .
some were left in muslim prayer halls , on doorsteps and even in rubbish bins .
many are found dead .
it is thought these children are mainly abandoned by single mothers .
having a child out of wedlock is still seen as deeply shameful in this muslim-majority country , where sex education is mainly focused on abstinence .
' the only solutio n '
the orphancare office is located in a quiet suburb outside kuala lumpur .
next to the front entrance is a small door that opens to a tiny cot .
once the baby is placed in the cot , an alarm is triggered and the air conditioner turns on .
when the door closes , the baby is safely locked inside and a caretaker fetches the child .
this way , the baby is kept safe , and the mother 's identity will never be known .
critics say the programme will make it too easy for mothers to abandon their babies , encouraging extra-marital sex .
but noraini hashim of orphancare says anonymity is the only way to ensure parents will use the hatch rather than toss their babies in a bin .
" we 're not out to prosecute the mother or the couple who brings the baby in , " she says .
it is illegal for muslims to have sex outside marriage in malaysia .
the country has a dual track legal system where islamic law applies to muslims .
non-muslims are covered under civil law .
but the stigma of having a child out of wedlock is what drives single mothers to desperate acts , says ms noraini .
she says the pressure is greater for young girls when their boyfriends leave them and they feel unable to confide in family or friends .
" in that state of depression i suppose the only solution they have is to abandon the baby , " ms noraini says .
the government , concerned by the rising number of abandoned babies , has asked police to start investigating these cases as attempted murder or murder , which carry the death sentence .
' shameful '
close to the busy centre of kuala lumpur is a shelter for unmarried , pregnant women .
the kewaja refuge is one of the few places they can turn to since abortion is not readily available .
it is made up of a row of single-storey houses at the end of a dirt road , partly hidden by banana trees .
the women all wear headscarves and oversized t-shirts to hide their swollen bellies .
they will stay at the shelter until their babies are born .
three women agreed to tell me their stories under condition of anonymity .
one 19-year-old girl , who calls herself su , says she went to the shelter when she was five months pregnant so she would n't shame the family in front of the neighbours .
siti , 18 , gave birth to a baby girl at the shelter .
her father thinks she is away studying .
she ca n't return home until her mother calls her back .
she 's been waiting for over a month .
mila is 28 and came to the shelter in her final month of pregnancy .
unlike the other two she is engaged and has a steady job but she still feels unable to keep her child because having sex before marriage is forbidden in islam .
" if the baby knew he was born out of wedlock he will carry the shame for the rest of his life ," she says .
all three women told me they knew about contraception but were too ashamed to buy it .
the shelter is run by yahya yusof and his wife .
he says shelters like his and the baby hatch help to save lives , but it does n't tackle the problem of unwanted pregnancies .
mr yahya says they are seeing an increase every month .
when we started 14 years ago , we had fewer than 10 girls at the shelter .
but now , we have at least 70 pregnant women under our care .
to keep their pregnancy secret , most of the women who stay at the kewaja shelter will give their babies up for adoption .
in this country , unwed mothers still feel they have little choice .
us to mark 9 years since september 11 attacks
saturday marks the ninth anniversary of the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states .
the country has planned a series of events to honor the nearly 3,000 people killed in the coordinated assaults by al-qaida hijackers .
the hijackers took over four commercial airliners , crashing two of them into the twin towers of the world trade center in new york city .
the 110-story buildings collapsed , trapping and killing many employees and rescue workers .
another plane hit the pentagon , the u.s. military headquarters just outside washington , while the fourth went down in shanksville , pennsylvania after passengers fought their hijackers .
that plane is believed to have been destined for washington .
president barack obama will commemorate the anniversary at pentagon , while vice president joe biden will attend a ceremony in new york .
first lady michelle obama and former first lady laura bush are scheduled to speak at a ceremony in shanksville .
added to this year 's anniversary is bitter controversy about plans by a muslim group to build an islamic cultural center and mosque near the former site of the world trade center .
opponents say the proposal is disrespectful to the victims of the 2001 attacks , while supporters say the center will help bridge differences between the west and the islamic world .
president obama has said he supports muslims ' right to build a place of worship near the site , known as ground zero , but he also said he would not comment on the " wisdom " of doing so .
critics , including some republican lawmakers , accused him of being insensitive to the families of the victims .
work continues at ground zero , on a museum and memorial to pay tribute to those who died in the 2001 attacks .
in 2008 , an outdoor memorial opened at the pentagon .
a national memorial also is being built at the flight 93 crash site in pennsylvania .
key democrats split with obama on taxes
washington ( cnn ) -- despite president obama 's accusation wednesday that republicans are holding middle class income tax cuts by tying them to an extension of tax cuts for wealthier americans , the reality is several democratic senators also oppose allowing president bush 's tax cuts for higher earners to expire .
democrats ben nelson of nebraska , evan bayh of indiana , kent conrad of north dakota , and independent joe lieberman of connecticut have each publicly expressed concern about the impact of raising taxes , even on the well-to-do , during an economic downturn .
" the general rule of thumb would be you do n't want to do tax changes , tax increases ... until the recovery is on more solid ground , " conrad said recently , summarizing their view .
each has said the tax cuts should be extended at least temporarily .
senate democratic leaders know it will be virtually impossible to pass a controversial tax bill without the support of all their members but intend to press ahead with the debate later this month .
they believe the political and fiscal arguments are on their side and that allowing the tax cuts for the wealthy to expire is " the consensus position of the caucus , " even if a few democrats oppose doing so .
" there is bipartisan consensus that we should not raise taxes , " retorted a senior senate republican leadership aide , seizing on the division in the democratic ranks .
the gop aide did n't rule out a compromise that involved passing a short-term extension , a proposal put forth by house majority leader john boehner .
" if the only way to pass a bill that did n't raise taxes would to pass a temporary extension , we 'd be open to talking about it , " said the aide .
but the democratic aide doubted republicans would seriously work to help democrats pass a bill this close to the november election .
" i do n't believe the republicans are interested in compromise , " he said .
tony blair criticises coalition prison policies
former prime minister tony blair has criticised the prison policies being pursued by the coalition government .
mr blair told the daily telegraph he " profoundly disagrees " with the approach adopted by justice secretary kenneth clarke .
mr clarke has outlined a " radical " shift from jail sentences to more community-based punishments to focus on rehabilitation and save money .
more than 85,000 people are currently in prison in england and wales .
the justice secretary said he wants to " shut the revolving door of crime and reoffending " .
new measures will involve paying private firms and voluntary groups according to how many prisoners they rehabilitate .
in a speech in june , mr clarke said prison had too often proved a " costly and ineffectual approach that fails to turn criminals into law-abiding citizens " .
the justice secretary said that he would have regarded it as " impossible and ridiculous " when he was home secretary in the 1990s if someone had told him that by 2010 the prison population would have doubled to more than 80,000 .
but in an interview with the telegraph , mr blair said there was a need to imprison " those who deserve to be there " .
the former prime minister said " dysfunctional families who produce 14-year-old kids stabbing one another to death " are " making people 's lives hell " and suggested britain could learn from developing countries which " just do n't accept " criminality .
mr blair 's comments amount to his first direct policy assault on the coalition since david cameron won power from labour in may .
the former prime minister , who recently published his memoir , once famously promised to be " tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime " .
germany contradicts french statement on roma camps
france and germany are embroiled in a diplomatic row after german chancellor angela merkel flatly contradicted president nicolas sarkozy on the issue of roma camps .
the issue of roma ( gypsy ) deportations from france has dominated an eu summit .
mr sarkozy told a news conference that chancellor merkel had said to him that she intended to follow france 's example in dismantling roma camps .
mrs merkel 's spokesman denied she had discussed the issue with mr sarkozy .
fresh from a blazing row with the president of the european commission , president sarkozy has managed to fall out with his closest ally in europe , says the bbc 's oana lungescu , who was at the summit in brussels .
heated exchange
mr sarkozy told reporters at the summit that chancellor merkel had said she intended to dismantle roma camps in the coming weeks .
he predicted the action could unsettle german politics .
but promptly after landing in berlin , the chancellor 's spokesman firmly denied that mrs merkel had discussed any so-called roma camps with the french president during the summit or on the margins , let alone their evacuation .
during the summit , mr sarkozy clashed with the european commission over the matter of roma deportations .
since august , france has dismantled about 200 roma settlements and deported about 1,000 of their inhabitants to romania and bul garia .
it has also evicted french nationals from illegal traveller settlements .
earlier this week , the eu justice commissioner viviane reding had appeared to compare france 's actions to persecutions in nazi-occupied france .
" the disgusting and shameful words that were used - world war ii , the evocation of the jews - was something that shocked us deeply , " mr sarkozy said .
he then went on to have a heated exchange with the eu commission president , jose manuel barroso .
this is an unprecedented row between brussels and paris , our correspondent says .
mr barroso recognised that some excessive comments had been made , but insisted that discrimination against ethnic minorities was unacceptable .
" it is true that in the past few weeks , some things have been said that are out of order , " mr barroso admitted .
ms reding , the eu commissioner from luxembourg , said on tuesday : " this is a situation i had thought europe would not have to witness again after the second world war . "
she also urged the european commission to take legal action against france over the deportations .
ms reding later said she regretted interpretations of her statement .
although france has deported thousands of romanian and bulgarian roma over the past few years , it began accelerating the process last month , as part of a high-profile crackdown on illegal camps in the country .
on monday , euro mps accused the commission of failing to protect the roma deported from france .
in all , mr sarkozy said around 500 camps were dismantled in august , of which 199 were roma settlements .
about 5,400 people were evicted from the roma camps , but the majority of those living in the camps were french nationals , the president said .
the president 's assertions appeared to contradict a leaked memo from the french interior ministry which surfaced on monday .
it showed the authorities had been instructed to target roma camps , rather than deal with migrants on a case-by-case basis , as the french migration minister and the minister for europe had assured the european commission .
un summit aims to reduce poverty , hunger and disease
world leaders are meeting at the united nations for the second day of a summit aimed at drastically reducing global poverty , hunger and disease within the next five years .
the three-day meeting is intended to review progress and commit to concrete steps to reach the millennium development goals on schedule .
u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon has called on the leaders to honor aid commitments made 10 years ago .
u.n. members resolved a decade ago to reduce extreme poverty , ensure every child finishes primary school and stop the hiv/aids pandemic .
they also vowed to reduce child mortality , improve maternal health and reduce the number of people worldwide who do not have access to clean water and basic sanitation .
but a u.n. report earlier this year said several of the millennium development goals are lagging and could fail without additional efforts .
in his speech tuesday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad called for the creation of what he called a " just world order " and said the united nations should seek a decade " for joint global governance . "
he did not mention tensions over iran 's disputed nuclear program and sanctions imposed by governments and international bodies , including the united nations .
he blamed much of the world 's tensions on what he called undemocratic and unjust governance .
also at the summit tuesday , zimbabwean president robert mugabe condemned western sanctions against him and his close supporters .
he described the sanctions as hindrances , hurting development in zimbabwe .
for her part , german chancellor angela merkel called on world leaders to continue working to fulfill the millenium development goals .
she said the primary responsibility for development lies with the governments of developed countries .
presidents and prime ministers from 140 countries are attending the summit .
u.s. president barack obama addresses the forum wednesday , on its final day .
the meeting comes ahead of the general debate of world leaders at the u.n. general assembly , which begins on thursday .
ahmadinejad un speech sparks walk-outs
the us and other western delegations at the 65th un general assembly have walked out in protest at the speech of the iranian president
mahmoud ahmadinejad said some saw the 11 september attacks on the us as part of a us conspiracy to protect israel .
mr ahmadinejad was speaking on the first day of a week-long un diplomatic marathon at its new york headquarters .
the us denounced his remarks on the 2001 attacks , which killed nearly 3,000 people , as " abhorrent and delusional " .
the american delegation was joined in its walk-out by representatives from 32 other nations - including the eu countries , canada , australia , new zealand and costa rica.
but mr ahmadinejad appeared undaunted by the protest , continuing his attack on zionism and israel , says bbc diplomatic correspondent jonathan marcus
capitalist 'failures '
the iranian president 's speech was part political diatribe , part sermon , adds our correspondent - a wide-ranging presentation of his own particular world view .
the iranian president said he would host a conference on terrorism next year and that 2011 should be the year of nuclear disarmament .
repeating iran 's denial that it was seeking the capacity to build nuclear weapons , mr ahmadinejad said some members of the un security council had " equated nuclear energy with nuclear bombs " .
he also said tehran would not submit to what he called unnecessary pressure from the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency .
mr ahmadinejad had started his speech by outlining what he called the failure of the existing world order and capitalism , saying the world should be run by virtuous people like the prophets .
although he said that was ready to have a serious discussion with us statesmen , our correspondent says that on the evidence of this speech there would be little for them to talk about .
in response to this speech , mark kornblau , spokesman for the us mission at the united nations , told afp news agency : " rather than representing the aspirations and goodwill of the iranian people , mr ahmadinejad has yet again chosen to spout vile conspiracy theories and anti-semitic slurs that are as abhorrent and delusional as they are predictable . "
at the un general assembly , leaders take to the stage to make speeches on a subject of their choice
iran has already endured four rounds of increasingly punitive economic sanctions over the nuclear dispute .
foreign ministers from countries including the us , uk , china , france , germany and russia discussed the issue at a meeting on wednesday , and it is also likely to be raised on the fringes of the general assembly .
dozens of fringe meetings take place and correspondents say they constitute the most important of this event .
peace-keeping in somalia , the possible break-up of sudan , the conflict in yemen , climate change and un reform are all set to feature in these smaller meetings .
'hard realities '
speaking shortly after un secretary general ban ki-moon launched the diplomatic marathon on thursday , us president barack obama urged the audience to support israeli-palestinian peace negotiations which started on 2 september .
he said those longing for an independent palestine must not tear down israel , and called on israel to extend a moratorium on building new settlements in the west bank and east jerusalem .
mr obama accepted that many remained pessimistic about this peace process , with cynics saying the two sides were distrustful of each other , and too divided internally , to forge lasting peace .
" some say that the gaps between the parties are too big ; the potential for talks to break down is too great ; and that after decades of failure , peace is simply not possible . "
but the us president called on his fellow leaders to consider the alternative .
" if an agreement is not reached , palestinians will never know the pride and dignity that comes with their own state .
israelis will never know the certainty and security that comes with sovereign and stable neighbours who are committed to co-existence .
" the hard realities of demography will take hold .
more blood will be shed .
this holy land will remain a symbol of our differences , instead of our common humanity . "
in his opening address , mr ban urged the nations to stand together in a time of growing challenges and uncertainty .
he said the un provided a moral compass for a world in which social inequalities were growing , with women and children bearing the brunt .
he called for a " stronger un for a better world " .
mr ban said the un had embraced an ambitious agenda for a more prosperous world free of poverty , and for a greener , safer world free of nuclear weapons .
obama pledges revamp of foreign aid policy
us president obama : " we need to be big hearted but also hard headed "
president barack obama has told the un a revamped us foreign aid policy will help lift nations out of poverty by focusing on good governance and encouraging trade and investment .
mr obama told the un summit in new york on the millennium development goals that the focus should be on development not dependence .
but he insisted helping poor nations was in the us interest .
he said the us would do its part to help lift millions out of poverty .
but with five years left to reach the millennium development goals ( mdg ) , mr obama said the world " must do better " .
" instability "
the eight mdgs were adopted in 2000 , and include improving health care , increasing access to education and promoting equal rights for women .
" if the international community just keeps doing the same things the same way , we will miss many development goals , " mr obama said .
he said it was in america 's , and other rich nations ' , interests to help the world 's poorer countries , despite the economic downturn .
" in our global economy , progress in even the poorest countries can advance the prosperity and security of people far beyond their borders , including my fellow americans . "
he said : " when millions of fathers cannot provide for their families , it feeds the despair that can fuel instability and violent extremism . "
millennium development goals
1 eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
2 achieve universal primary education
3 promote gender equality and empower women
4 reduce child mortality
5 improve maternal health
6 combat hiv aids , malaria and other diseases
7 ensure environmental sustainability
8 develop a global partnership for development
he announced a new focus in us aid on moving beyond providing assistance to offering " nations and peoples a path out of poverty " .
this would be done by working with co-operative nations to develop their economies over the long term .
countries that were willing to create attractive environments for investment and trade would be helped , mr obama said .
he also said democracy and good governance would be encouraged and corruption fought .
" we know that countries are more likely to prosper when governments are accountable to their people .
so we are leading a global effort to combat corruption .
" we will reach out to countries making the transition from authoritarianism to democracy , and from war to peace .
the people of liberia show that even after years of war , great progress can be achieved " .
bbc diplomatic correspondent jonathan marcus says this was a restrained , even humble speech , suggesting an america that wants to listen to others whilst still willing to lead on the global stage .
earlier , deputy pm nick clegg confirmed that the uk was committed to increasing the money it gave in overseas aid , and called on other rich nations to follow its lead .
mr clegg told the un that the uk would raise its spending on aid from 0.5 % of annual economic output to 0.7 % from 2013 .
earlier in the day the un launched a $ 40bn ( £25.5bn ) health initiative aimed at saving the lives of 16 million women and children over the next five years .
announcing the global strategy for women 's and children 's health , un secretary general ban ki-moon said women and children " play a crucial role in development " .
pentagon destroys thousands of copies of army officer 's memoir
washington ( cnn ) -- the department of defense recently purchased and destroyed thousands of copies of an army reserve officer 's memoir in an effort to safeguard state secrets , a spokeswoman said saturday .
" dod decided to purchase copies of the first printing because they contained information which could cause damage to national security , " pentagon spokeswoman lt. col. april cunningham said .
in a statement to cnn , cunningham said defense officials observed the september 20 destruction of 9,500 copies of lt. col. anthony shaffer 's new memoir " o peration dark heart . "
shaffer says he was notified friday about the pentagon 's purchase .
shaffer told cnn on saturday .
" the whole premise smacks of retaliation , someone buying 10,000 books to suppress a story in this digital age is ludicrous . "
shaffer 's publisher , st. martin 's press , released a second of this book .
it said had incorporated some changes the government had sought " while redacting other text he ( shaffer ) was told was classified "
from single words and names to entire paragraphs , blacked out lines appear throughout the book 's 299 pages .
cnn obtained a memo from the defense intelligence agency dated august 6 in which lt. gen. ronald burgess claims the dia tried for nearly two months to get a copy of the manuscript .
burgess said the dia 's investigation " identified significant classified information , the release of which i have determined could be expected to cause serious damage to national security . "
burgess said this manuscript contained secret activities of the u.s. special operations command , cia and national security agency .
shaffer 's lawyer , mark zaid , said earlier this month that the book was reviewed by shaffer 's military superiors prior to publication .
" there was a green light from the army reserve command , " zaid told cnn.
but intelligence agencies apparently raised objections when they received copies of the book .
the pentagon contacted st. martin 's press in early august to convey its concerns over the release of the book .
according to this publisher , at that time the first printings were just about to be shipped from its warehouse .
shaffer said he and the publisher worked hard " to make sure nothing in the book would be detrimental to national security . "
" when you look at what they took out ( in the 2nd edition ) , it 's lunacy , " shaffer said .
the pentagon says shaffer should have sought wider for the memoir .
" he did clear it with army reserve but not with the larger army and with department of defense , " department of defense spokesman col. david lapan said earlier this month .
" so he did not meet the requirements under department of defense regulations for security review . "
one of this book 's first lines , " here i was in afghanistan ( redaction ) .
my job : to run the defense intelligence agency 's operations out of ( redaction ) the hub for u.s. operations in country . "
in chapter 15 , titled " tipping point , " 21 lines within this first two pages are blacked out .
in the memoir , shaffer recalls his time in afghanistan leading a black-ops team during the bush administration .
the bronze star medal recipient told cnn he believes the bush administraton 's biggest mistake during this time was misunderstanding the culture there .
defense officials said they are in the process of reimbursing the publisher for the cost of the first printing and have not purchased copies of the redacted version .
at least one seller on the online auction site ebay claiming to have a first-edition printing is selling it for an asking price of nearly $ 2,000 .
the listed retail price for the second printing is $ 25.99 .
ecuador declares state of emergency amid ' coup attempt '
a state of emergency has been declared in ecuador after president rafael correa accused the opposition and security forces of a coup attempt .
mr correa remains in hospital amid reports of fresh violence outside and government claims that security forces will not allow the president to leave .
troops took over quito 's airport , forcing it to close for hours .
unrest has been reported across ecuador amid anger at a new law cutting benefits for public servants .
supporters said security forces were not allowing the president to leave the police hospital , where he went for treatment after being hit by teargas .
the minister responsible for security , miguel carvajal , said at least one person was killed and several others were injured during the unrest , but this could not be immediately confirmed .
mr correa has received strong support from governments throughout the americas , with a string of latin american nations and the us all speaking up for the embattled president .
in other developments on thursday :
police officers erect road blocks in quito , guayaquil and cuenca .
looting is reported in the capital and guayaquil .
banks are robbed , while schools and businesses close due to the lack of security
the head of the armed forces declares its loyalty to the president
venezuela 's president claims mr correa is " in danger of being killed "
peru and colombia close their borders with ecuador in solidarity .
the drama began on thursday morning when members of the armed forces and police angry at the austerity measures occupied several barracks and set up road blocks across the country .
tv stations showed images of police setting tyres on fire in the streets of quito , guayaquil and other cities .
the national assembly building was also occupied .
in a speech to soldiers from quito 's main barracks , president correa said :
" if you want to kill the president , here he is .
kill him if you are brave enough .
" if you want to seize the barracks , if you want to leave citizens undefended , if you want to betray the mission of the police force , go ahead .
but this government will do what has to be done .
this president will not take a step back . "
however , mr correa was forced to flee the barracks wearing a gas mask shortly afterwards when tear gas was fired by the protesters .
the president was later treated for the effects of the gas at a police hospital , from where he told local media that he had been " attacked " .
" they threw tear gas at us .
one exploded near my face .
it stunned me and my wife for a few seconds , probably minutes , " he said .
" i had to put on a gas mask and some cowards took it off me so i would suffocate .
" i mean they shot at the president - it 's incredible - our security forces , our national police . "
" it is a coup attempt led by the opposition and certain sections of the armed forces and the police , " he added .
" whatever happens to me i want to express my love for my family and my homeland . "
he blamed the patriotic society party ( psp ) , led by lucio gutierrez , for fomenting the unrest , and said " all bad elements " in the police force would " be removed " .
' kidnapped "
venezuelan president hugo chavez later reported that mr correa had told him by telephone from the hospital "that once he had left he would be very happy to receive ( the protesters ) , but that they had kidnapped him , and he would not give in to blackmail " .
" they are trying to oust president correa .
wake up the people of the bolivarian alliance !
wake up the people of unasur ( union of south american nations ) !
viva correa !
police later fired tear gas at supporters of the president who tried to break up their protest at the hospital , witnesses said .
meanwhile , about 300 air force personnel and soldiers took control of the runway at quito 's mariscal sucre international airport , causing flights to be grounded .
the airport later re-opened , the mayor of quito told reporters .
the protesters were carrying signs demanding the government give more respect to the military over benefits , witnesses said .
the us embassy said guayaquil 's airport was also closed and warned us citizens to " stay in their homes or current location , if safe " .
despite the unrest , the head of armed forces joint command , gen luis ernesto gonzalez villarreal , said the troops remained loyal .
" we live in a state which is governed by laws , and we are subordinate to the highest authority which is the president of the republic ," he said .
" we will take whatever appropriate action that government decides on . "
looting
the country 's central bank chief , diego bor ja , meanwhile urged its citizens not to withdraw money from banks amid reports of looting .
many schools and business were also closed because of the unrest .
a bbc news website reader , andrea m, said : " thieves have taken advantage of this situation , and started attacking people in the streets .
now , most people are at their homes , waiting to see what happens with the government . "
several leaders in this region expressed their support for mr correa , as did the organisation of american states ( oas ) .
its secretary-general miguel insulza called the situation " a coup d'etat in the making " .
peru and colombia both closed borders with ecuador , while the us said it backed mr correa and was " closely monitoring " the situation .
un secretary general ban ki-moon said he was deeply concerned for the president and called for a peaceful resolution to the crisis .
on wednesday , one minister said president correa was considering disbanding congress because members of his country alliance had threatened to block proposals to shrink the bureaucracy .
ecuador 's two-year-old constitution allows the president declare an impasse and rule by decree until new elections .
however , such a move would have to be approved by the constitutional court .
ecuador has a history of political instability .
protests toppled three presidents during economic turmoil in this decade before mr correa , a 47-year-old us-trained economist , took power in 2007 .
he was re-elected to a second term in 2009 despite a decision to default on $ 3.2 bn of global bonds causing widespread fiscal problems for the government .
mr correa declared this debt " illegitimate " .
china tycoon pledges fortune to charity
us billionaires bill gates and warren buffett are hosting a dinner in beijing for some of china 's richest individuals .
they are hoping to learn about philanthropy in china - and perhaps persuade some of their guests to give more to charity .
the bbc 's michael bristow spoke to one of those invited to dine .
businessman chen guangbiao has been inspired by this two us billionaires .
this 42-year-old is a well-known philanthropist , decided to go one step further when he got a call from bill gates and warren buffett .
mr chen wrote them a letter declaring that all his money will go to charity after he dies .
perhaps surprisingly , this news was not greeted with universal in china where giving to charity is not as established as in other countries .
there was particular criticism when people found out that mr chen does not even give money to his own siblings .
his sister earns 1,800 yuan ( $ 270 , £170 ) a month washing dishes in a hotel ; his brother earns only slightly more working as a security guard .
on that issue mr chen is unrepentant .
he said he had helped them in the past , but they had squandered his money .
he said his brother gambled and his sister began a loan business that eventually failed .
" i 'm determined never to help them again " he told the bbc in an interview at his plush beijing apartment .
entrepreneurial spirit
chen guangbiao 's story is a classic tale of rags to riches .
he was born into a poor family in anhui province , where it was a constant battle to survive .
he said his siblings died of starvation .
but from an early age mr chen began to understand two things that have guided him throughout his adult life : business and charity .
as a schoolboy he soon amassed what was to him a small fortune by selling anything he could - water , ice-cream - and doing odd jobs .
he has worked hard ever since , claiming never to have had a day off since he founded his company , huangpu renewable resources , in 1998 .
his firm recycles waste material from the construction industry , and has allowed mr chen to amass a fortune estimated at $ 440m .
charity was the second idea that this businessman learned about early , mainly from the example set by his mother .
" when other people 's kids had no milk , my mother would breastfeed them herself , " said the businessman .
she also invited beggars into their home to share their meagre meals .
mr chen 's first experience of helping others came as a youngster when he handed over his hard-earned money to pay for a neighbour 's school fees .
the father of two said giving was a habit he has maintained over the years .
inspired
a report on philanthropy in china published by the shanghai-based huran research institute earlier this year listed mr chen as the country 's fourth-most-generous giver .
it said he had donated $ 130m over the last five years to projects involved in health-care , disaster relief and education .
but the giving pledge campaign by mr gates and mr buffett has pushed mr chen to donate even more money .
this campaign urges us billionaires to give away more than half their wealth to charitable causes .
mr chen said this inspired him to announce he would give all his money away when he died .
his philosophy can be summed up in a passage from the letter he wrote to the american philanthropists telling them of his intention .
" if you have only a glass of water then one person can drink .
if you have a bucket a whole family can benefit . "
he added : " if you have a river , then you should share it with everyone . "
mr chen is not shy about telling people about his charity work .
" society needs hundreds of hundreds of thousands of chen guangbiaos , " he wrote in another letter published on his company 's website .
he admits that he is brash - but he believes that is the only way to encourage more people to give to charity .
china warns nobel committee not to honour dissident liu
by shirong chen bbc news
china has warned the nobel peace prize committee not to award the prize to well-known dissident liu xiaobo .
the chinese foreign ministry said giving him the prize would be against nobel principles .
mr liu is serving a long prison sentence for calling for democracy and human rights in china .
a foreign ministry spokeswoman told reporters in beijing that liu xiaobo was serving a jail term because he had violated chinese law .
awarding him the nobel peace prize would send the wrong message to the world , the spokeswoman said .
it would run contrary to the aims of its founder to promote peace between peoples , and to promote international friendship and disarmament , she added .
mr liu is serving an 11-year prison sentence for drafting charter 08 , which called for multiparty democracy and respect for human rights in china .
the ruling communist party perceived this to be a threat against it .
more than 100 chinese scholars , lawyers and campaigners have urged the nobel peace prize committee to honour him this year .
the former czech president , vaclav havel , has also voiced his support for the campaign .
trade talks
the head of the norwegian nobel institute , geir lundestad , said on monday that a senior chinese official had warned him that awarding the peace prize to liu xiaobo would affect relations between oslo and beijing .
china and norway are now engaged in talks over a bilateral trade deal , which some say could serve as a blueprint for an agreement between china and the european union .
energy-rich norway is also keen to export its offshore exploration know-how to china .
the norwegian oil firm statoil said last month that it was hoping to look for shale gas in china .
china was furious when the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama , won the nobel peace prize in 1989 , the year of the tiananmen square crackdown by chinese authorities on protesters .
the government tried to exert pressure on the committee last year when another dissident , hu jia , was nominated for the prize .
the committee will announce this year 's winner in 10 days .
europe hit by widespread strikes
strikes took place across europe wednesday in protest against government austerity measures .
unions say over 20 million jobs have been lost across europe since the economic downturn began.
workers from across europe took to the streets of brussels on wednesday in protest against european austerity measures .
police say most of the protesters marched on the headquarters of the european union .
union leaders hoped up to 100,000 people from 30 different countries would join the protest .
one of the demonstrators , evelain foncis , says people on low salaries should n't have to prop up the country - that should be the banks 's responsibility .
millions of people in europe have lost their jobs since the global financial downturn and european governments are reigning in public spending in a bid to combat major deficits .
even as workers protested in brussels on wednesday , the european union commission proposed sanctions against eu countries that fail to bring down their national deficits .
belgium was n't the only european country hit by protests wednesday .
in spain , unions , representing hundreds of thousands of workers , launched the country 's first general strike in eight years .
some strikers reportedly scuffled with police and bags of garbage were left uncollected on the streets ; protesters stopped trucks from delivering basic groceries and airlines were forced to cancel some flights .
the strikes were called in protest against a number of austerity measures including wage cuts for civil servants and a labor market reform that would have made it cheaper for companies to fire workers .
director of the general workers union in spain robert tormamira said in the past three years two million jobs have been destroyed .
elsewhere in europe , greek transport workers and hospital doctors walked off the job .
general secretary of the greek general confederation of labor vangelis bouzoulas said the people of europe are protesting against high prices and increased unemployment .
he said they are asking for better times and more work .
the greek government has implemented strict austerity measures that have led to a series of strikes and protests .
european countries handed greece more than $ 100 billion in rescue loans earlier this year in order to save its economy .
protests also took place wednesday in a number of other european countries , including poland , portugal , ireland , and italy .
father of the " test tube baby " edwards wins nobel prize
stockholm ( afp ) – ivf pioneer bob edwards , who brought the joy of parenthood to millions of infertile couples , won the nobel prize for medicine on monday , more than three decades after the first test tube birth .
in their first announcement of the annual prize season , the nobel committee hailed the 85-year-old briton 's work as " a milestone in the development of modern medicine " while the original test tube baby offered her congratulations .
" it 's fantastic news .
me and mum are so glad that one of the pioneers of ivf has been given the recognition he deserves , " said louise brown .
" we hold bob in great affection and are delighted to send our personal congratulations to him and his family at this time . "
her parents , lesley and john , had been trying to have children for nine years but could not because lesley brown 's fallopian tubes were blocked .
but thanks to edwards ' work in developing in-vitro fertilisation ( ivf ) , louise was born at oldham and district general hospital in north-west england , weighing five pounds 12 ounces ( 2.61 kilograms ) on july 25 , 1978 .
the ivf procedure entails taking an egg from a woman and fertilising it in a lab dish with sperm donated from a man .
the egg divides , is allowed to develop into an early-stage embryo and is then inserted in the woman 's uterus where , if all goes well , it will become a baby .
the vatican criticised the decision to honour edwards with the head of the pontifical academy for life , which speaks for the vatican on medical ethics issues , describing the move as " completely out of order " .
" without edwards , there would not be a market on which millions of ovocytes are sold ... and there would not be a large number of freezers filled with embryos in the world , " ansa news agency quoted ignacio carrasco de paula as saying .
" in the best of cases they are transferred into a uterus but most probably they will end up abandoned or dead , which is a problem for which the new nobel prize winner is responsible , " he added .
in a toned down transcript of the interview with ansa , he said the choice was understandable and specified he was speaking in a personal capacity .
after getting his doctorate in 1955 at edinburgh university , the manchester-born edwards then began working on developing the ivf process , first studying germ cells in animals .
since brown 's birth , nearly four million people have been born through ivf .
" his achievements have made it possible to treat infertility , a medical condition afflicting a large proportion of humanity including more than 10 percent of all couples worldwide , " the nobel assembly at the swedish karolinska institute said .
edwards is too frail to give interviews but his wife ruth said the family was " thrilled and delighted " at the honour .
he has in the past described how controversial his work had been .
" i was called crazy , " he told swedish news agency tt five years ago .
" no one wanted to take the ethical risk .
people told me the child would not be normal and wondered what i would do then .
but i was never worried , my research had showed that ivf worked just like natural conception , " he said .
edwards worked closely with british gynecologist patrick steptoe , who died in 1988 .
together they established the bourn hall clinic in cambridge , the world 's first centre for ivf therapy .
after he won the prestigious albert lasker award in 2001 , edwards told us broadcaster cbs he and steptoe " never thought the embryos would be born abnormal , even though famous people , including nobel prize winners , told me that i would have to do infanticide on the babies . "
today , 20 to 30 percent of eggs fertilised by ivf lead to the birth of a child .
" long-term follow-up studies have shown that ivf children are as healthy as other children , " the nobel jury said , pointing out that louise brown and a number of other ivf children have naturally given birth to children themselves .
edwards will receive a medal and 10 million swedish kronor ( 1.49 million dollars , 1.09 million euros ) .
the medicine prize kicked off a week of prestigious award announcements , with the two most watched , literature and peace , to be announced on thursday and friday .
security contractors in afghanistan ' fund taliban '
heavy us reliance on private security in afghanistan has helped to line the pockets of the taliban , a us senate report says .
the study by the senate armed services committee says this is because contractors often fail to vet local recruits and end up hiring warlords .
the report demands " immediate and aggressive steps " to improve the vetting and oversight process .
some 26,000 private security personnel , mostly afghans , operate in afghanistan .
nine out of 10 of them work for the us government .
private security firms in afghanistan provide guards for everything from diplomatic missions and aid agencies to supply convoys .
in august , afghan president hamid karzai gave private security companies four months to end operations in afghanistan .
' mr white '
" all too often our reliance on private security contractors in afghanistan has empowered warlords , powerbrokers operating outside afghan government control " , democratic senator carl levin , chairman of the senate committee , said .
" these contractors threaten the security of our troops and risk the success of our mission " , he added .
the report paints a disturbing picture of how some of those hired have little training or experience in firing weapons , while other contractors are warlords with known links to the taliban , the bbc 's steve kingstone in washington says .
the document gives several notorious examples , including a man the americans have nicknamed mr white - after a character in the violent film reservoir dogs .
he is said to have funded the taliban and to have hosted a meeting with a senior commander responsible for a wave of roadside bombs targeting nato troops .
the report also says that - by funding warlords with their own private militias - the us is undermining its declared aim of creating a more stable afghanistan .
report warns that the growth of a lucrative private security industry has drawn new recruits away from the afghan police and army , where salaries are lower .
the study follows july 's congressional inquiry , which said that trucking contractors paid tens of millions of dollars a year to local warlords for convoy protection .
in recent months , us forces in afghanistan have pledged to increase their oversight of security contractors and set up task forces to track the money spent among sub-contractors .

she told afp news agency :
" i want to thank everyone for supporting liu xiaobo .
i strongly ask that the chinese government release liu . "
mrs liu said police had informed her they would take her to mr liu 's prison in the north-eastern province of liaoning on saturday so she could give him the news .
the prize is worth 10 million swedish crowns ( $ 1.5m ; £944,000 ) and will be awarded in oslo on 10 december .
us president barack obama said mr liu had " has sacrificed his freedom for his beliefs " and called for his speedy release .
german government spokesman steffen seibert said china should free him so he could attend the ceremony .
france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner also welcomed the award and also called on china to release mr liu .
un human rights commissioner navi pillay said the prize recognised a " very prominent human rights defender " .
the london-based rights group amnesty international said mr liu was a " worthy winner " .
but catherine baber , amnesty 's deputy asia-pacific director , added : " this award can only make a real difference if it prompts more international pressure on china to release liu , along with the numerous other prisoners of conscience languishing in chinese jails . "
no candidates are announced ahead of the peace prize but others mentioned in the media included afghan women 's rights activist sima samar , russian human rights activist svetlana gannushkina , former german chancellor helmut kohl and zimbabwean prime minister morgan tsvangirai .
the nobel committee had to defend last year 's controversial peace prize choice of us president barack obama .

besides kraft 's irene rosenfeld , there is indra nooyi , the head of beverage giant pepsico , and gail kelly , chief executive of australian bank westpac .
chile : first rescued miners leave hospital
three of the 33 men rescued after 69 days trapped in the san jose mine in chile have been discharged from hospital and allowed to go home .
the three , who were not officially identified , left in a white car amid tight security .
doctors said all the miners had responded well to treatment and many more of them would go home on friday .
earlier president sebastian pinera visited them and promised to stamp out " inhuman " working conditions in chile .
copiapo hospital 's deputy medical director dr jorge montes the three men who left would be allowed to carry out physical activity and would need sunglasses only if they were exposed to intense light .
however , he warned that " the psychological condition of the patients is something we cannot predict " .
dramatic rescue
the miners had been told they would need to be held in the hospital for 48 hours but health minister jaime manalich announced earlier that their condition was so good that many would be able to leave within 24 hours .
he said their condition was nothing short of a miracle .
some of the men have been given dental surgery and two have the lung disease , silicosis : mario sepulveda , the second miner to have been rescued , and mario gomez , 63 , who is on a course of antibiotics for pneumonia .
the miners were hauled to the surface one at a time in a complicated and dramatic operation that took about 22 hours from the time the first miner reached the ground .
they were winched up a narrow shaft in a metal capsule from where they had been trapped 625m ( 2,050 feet ) below ground since the mine partially collapsed on 5 august .
" the trip up was calm , " said rescued miner richard villarroel .
everything was well prepared .
i came up listening to music .
he and the 32 other miners have set a world record for surviving the longest time trapped underground .
as they arrived at the surface , each miner was greeted by president pinera , he promised a review that would lead to a " very radical change " affecting the health and safety of workers in mining as well as the transport , fishing and construction industries .
he said it was impossible to guarantee that chile would never face such an accident in the future .
" but we can guarantee one thing : in our country will we never allow again working in conditions so inhuman and so unsafe as happened in the san jose mine and many other places in our country . "
he told the miners there will be a big celebration for them on 25 october , in the capital santiago .
he also invited them for a game of football the same day against the officials who had helped rescue them .
mr pinera joked that the winners would be allowed to live at the presidential palace , la moneda , while the losers would have to go back down the mine .
offers
the miners survived the first 17 days of their ordeal by eking out rations that were meant to last just a few days before rescuers found them via a probe lowered down a bore hole about the width of a grapefruit .
food and other supplies were lowered to the men while they waited for a larger shaft to be drilled for their rescue .
now that the men are safe , thoughts have turned to their emotional wellbeing .
an insight into how the miners are adjusting to life above ground has come from a diary written for the bbc by the three children of omar reygadas , the 17th to be freed .
one of the children , ximena , has described how her father has become so pale after his 69 days underground that he resembles the cartoon ghost , casper .
in general , he 's in good spirits .
but then when he remembers the first few days after the accident , he starts crying , he gets very upset , she wrote .
" but then he pulls himself together and his spirits are high once more . "
the chilean government has promised to care for the miners for at least six months .
offers and invitations to the men have begun to pour in .
european football clubs manchester united and real madrid have invited the 33 to watch them play and they have also received offers of holidays and tv appearances .
they are also expected to receive offers of jobs , advertising deals , book and movie contracts to tell their extraordinary stories
typhoon megi death toll rises to three in philippines
baguio , philippines ( afp ) – philippine authorities said tuesday the death toll from typhoon megi had risen to three , as the storm dumped heavy rains across the main island of luzon for a second consecutive day .
many areas in northern isabela province , which bore the brunt of megi 's fury , remained without power and communication facilities after being lashed by wind gusts of up to 260 kilometres ( 161 miles ) an hour on monday .
in its latest update on tuesday morning , the disaster risk reduction management council said a man and a woman were crushed by fallen trees separately in the northern philippines on monday .
a 53-year-old man was previously reported dead after he drowned in a swollen river at the height of the typhoon in another area of the north .
the head of the philippine red cross , gwen pang , said it was too early to know the extent of the damage .
" we are hoping that the casualties remain low , " pang told afp .
" we ca n't say it will not go up , but people were more prepared this time . "
what we are expecting is more reports of heavy damage .
there are still many areas without power and communications , while some roads are cut off by landslides .
megi , the strongest typhoon to hit the philippines in four years , slammed into isabela province at midday ( 04:00 gmt ) on monday , bringing heavy rains and winds that tore roofs off houses .
it then cut a westward path and exited luzon 's western coast at midnight .
by tuesday morning it was about 210 kilometres ( 130 miles ) off the west coast of luzon and heading toward the south china sea , the state weather bureau said .
but the storm continued to dump heavy rains across luzon .
classes remained suspended in several northern provinces tuesday , while isabela was declared under a " state of calamity " allowing it to tap into emergency funding .
typhoon heads for south china after striking philippines
people save their belongings in ilagan township , a day after typhoon megi ( local name ' juan ' ) barreled through isabela province in northeastern philippines , 19 oct. 2010
typhoon megi is heading toward southern china after killing at least 13 people in the northern philippines .
chinese forecasters say the center of the storm is expected to pass between hainan and hong kong islands on the way to the mainland guangdong province .
they say the typhoon will bring torrential rain to the province during the next few days .
chinese official news agency xinhua quotes local authorities as saying it is too early to tell where and when megi will make landfall , but that central and western parts of the province are the most vulnerable .
thousands of people have been evacuated from guangdong 's coastal areas .
disaster officials have ordered civil affairs departments to prepare for relief operations .
in the philippines , president benigno aquino said careful preparation kept the death toll relatively low after the typhoon swept over northern luzon island .
u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton expressed condolences to the philippines for the damage and loss of life the storm caused .
typhoon megi flattened parts of luzon island with winds of up to 225 kilometers per hour .
it left in ruins many parts of isabella province , the most populated in luzon 's cagayan valley .
the storm uprooted trees , tore roofs from houses and destroyed crucial rice crops .
thousands of people were moved into typ hoon-safe buildings ahead of the storm , and rescue teams with emergency supplies were pre-positioned in critical areas .
megi was the strongest storm to hit the philippines in four years .
it lost some of its force while crossing the mountains of luzon , but is strengthening over the south china sea .
china has issued warnings for fujian , guangdong , guangxi and hainan provinces as the country braces for possibly the biggest storm to hit china this year .
us presidential nuclear codes lost for months
the codes used by the president to launch a nuclear strike were mislaid for months during the clinton administration , the former highest-ranking officer has said .
ex-chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen hugh shelton made the claim in a new book .
the codes are usually held by an aide who remains close to the president .
gen shelton said there was an incident where an aide said the codes had been lost .
they were immediately replaced , but an internal inquiry was conducted .
gen shelton said the incident had taken place " around the year 2000 " .
under the procedures , an official was sent every month to check the codes , and that they were replaced every four months with new codes .
according to gen shelton 's book , without hesitation , an official had gone to check one month and been told by the aide that the codes were on the president 's person but that he was in an important meeting and could not be disturbed .
a different official went to do the same check a month later and was told a similar story .
when it came time to change the codes , an aide admitted code had been missing for months .
gen shelton said it was apparent that the president had not had the codes and that he had been unaware that an aide had lost them .
the general described the episode as a " comedy of errors " .
